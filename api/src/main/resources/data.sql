SHERLOCK HOLMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\r\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\r\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\r\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\r\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before\r\nI could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\r\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\r\nwas already deep in the enemy\u2019s country. I followed, however, with many\r\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\r\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\r\nentered upon my new duties.\r\n\r\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\r\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\r\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\r\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\r\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\r\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\r\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\r\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\r\n\r\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\r\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\r\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\r\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\r\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\r\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\r\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and\r\nemaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost\r\nin sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the\r\ntroopship \u201cOrontes,\u201d and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with\r\nmy health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal\r\ngovernment to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\r\n\r\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\r\nair--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\r\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\r\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\r\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at\r\na private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\r\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\r\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that\r\nI soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\r\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\r\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\r\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\r\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\r\n\r\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\r\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\r\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\r\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is\r\na pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never\r\nbeen a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,\r\nand he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the\r\nexuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and\r\nwe started off together in a hansom.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?\u201d he asked in\r\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\r\n\u201cYou are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.\u201d\r\n\r\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\r\nby the time that we reached our destination.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor'), NULL);

He is a little queer\r\nin his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\r\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA medical student, I suppose?\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\r\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\r\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\r\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way\r\nknowledge which would astonish his professors.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you never ask him what he was going in for?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\r\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to meet him,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I am to lodge with anyone, I\r\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\r\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\r\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\r\ncould I meet this friend of yours?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is sure to be at the laboratory,\u201d returned my companion. \u201cHe either\r\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\r\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\r\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\r\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t blame me if you don\u2019t get on with him,\u201d he said; \u201cI know\r\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in\r\nthe laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me\r\nresponsible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get on it will be easy to part company,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt\r\nseems to me, Stamford,\u201d I added, looking hard at my companion, \u201cthat you\r\nhave some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow\u2019s\r\ntemper so formidable, or what is it? Don\u2019t be mealy-mouthed about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not easy to express the inexpressible,\u201d he answered with a laugh.\r\n\u201cHolmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it approaches to\r\ncold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of\r\nthe latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand,\r\nbut simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea\r\nof the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself\r\nwith the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and\r\nexact knowledge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery right too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the\r\nsubjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking\r\nrather a bizarre shape.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBeating the subjects!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death.

It was familiar ground to me,\r\nand I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and\r\nmade our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed\r\nwall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage\r\nbranched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.\r\n\r\nThis was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\r\nBroad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,\r\ntest-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.\r\nThere was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant\r\ntable absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round\r\nand sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \u201cI\u2019ve found it! I\u2019ve\r\nfound it,\u201d he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a\r\ntest-tube in his hand. \u201cI have found a re-agent which is precipitated\r\nby hoemoglobin, [4] and by nothing else.\u201d Had he discovered a gold mine,\r\ngreater delight could not have shone upon his features.\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d said Stamford, introducing us.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength\r\nfor which I should hardly have given him credit. \u201cYou have been in\r\nAfghanistan, I perceive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow on earth did you know that?\u201d I asked in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said he, chuckling to himself. \u201cThe question now is about\r\nhoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of\r\nmine?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is interesting, chemically, no doubt,\u201d I answered, \u201cbut\r\npractically----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\r\nDon\u2019t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come\r\nover here now!\u201d He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and\r\ndrew me over to the table at which he had been working. \u201cLet us have\r\nsome fresh blood,\u201d he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and\r\ndrawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. \u201cNow, I\r\nadd this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that\r\nthe resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion\r\nof blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however,\r\nthat we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.\u201d As he\r\nspoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added\r\nsome drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a\r\ndull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom\r\nof the glass jar.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\r\nchild with a new toy. \u201cWhat do you think of that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to be a very delicate test,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\r\nuncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The\r\nlatter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears\r\nto act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been\r\ninvented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long\r\nago have paid the penalty of their crimes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed!\u201d I murmured.\r\n\r\n\u201cCriminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\r\nsuspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His\r\nlinen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them.\r\nAre they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains,\r\nor what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert,\r\nand why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock\r\nHolmes\u2019 test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\r\nheart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are to be congratulated,\u201d I remarked, considerably surprised at his\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year.

What\r\nhave you to confess now? It\u2019s just as well for two fellows to know the\r\nworst of one another before they begin to live together.\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed at this cross-examination. \u201cI keep a bull pup,\u201d I said, \u201cand\r\nI object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts\r\nof ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices\r\nwhen I\u2019m well, but those are the principal ones at present.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you include violin-playing in your category of rows?\u201d he asked,\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt depends on the player,\u201d I answered. \u201cA well-played violin is a treat\r\nfor the gods--a badly-played one----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s all right,\u201d he cried, with a merry laugh. \u201cI think we may\r\nconsider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen shall we see them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCall for me here at noon to-morrow, and we\u2019ll go together and settle\r\neverything,\u201d he answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right--noon exactly,\u201d said I, shaking his hand.\r\n\r\nWe left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards\r\nmy hotel.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, \u201chow\r\nthe deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?\u201d\r\n\r\nMy companion smiled an enigmatical smile. \u201cThat\u2019s just his little\r\npeculiarity,\u201d he said. \u201cA good many people have wanted to know how he\r\nfinds things out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! a mystery is it?\u201d I cried, rubbing my hands. \u201cThis is very piquant.\r\nI am much obliged to you for bringing us together. \u2018The proper study of\r\nmankind is man,\u2019 you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must study him, then,\u201d Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find him a knotty problem, though.

They\r\nconsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large\r\nairy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\r\nwindows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate\r\ndid the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was\r\nconcluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.\r\nThat very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\r\nfollowing '), NULL);

For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and\r\nlaying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we\r\ngradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nHolmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet\r\nin his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be\r\nup after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\r\nbefore I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical\r\nlaboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long\r\nwalks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City.\r\nNothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but\r\nnow and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would\r\nlie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving\r\na muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such\r\na dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him\r\nof being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance\r\nand cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.\r\n\r\nAs the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\r\naims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and\r\nappearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\r\nobserver. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\r\nlean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and\r\npiercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded;\r\nand his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of\r\nalertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness\r\nwhich mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably\r\nblotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of\r\nextraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe\r\nwhen I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.\r\n\r\nThe reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how\r\nmuch this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured\r\nto break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned\r\nhimself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\r\nobjectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention.\r\nMy health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was\r\nexceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and\r\nbreak the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, I\r\neagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and\r\nspent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.\r\n\r\nHe was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\r\nconfirmed Stamford\u2019s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to\r\nhave pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in\r\nscience or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance\r\ninto the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable,\r\nand within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample\r\nand minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man\r\nwould work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some\r\ndefinite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the\r\nexactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters\r\nunless he has some very good reason for doing so.\r\n\r\nHis ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary\r\nliterature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing.\r\nUpon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he\r\nmight be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however,\r\nwhen I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory\r\nand of the composition of the Solar System.

Therefore all the knowledge which he\r\npossessed was such as would be useful to him.

Clearly they\r\nreflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided\r\nthose thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim\r\nor fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against\r\nthese exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them\r\nby playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a\r\nslight compensation for the trial upon my patience.\r\n\r\nDuring the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think\r\nthat my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,\r\nhowever, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most\r\ndifferent classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,\r\ndark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came\r\nthree or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,\r\nfashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same\r\nafternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew\r\npedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely\r\nfollowed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old\r\nwhite-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on\r\nanother a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these\r\nnondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to\r\nbeg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.\r\nHe always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. \u201cI have\r\nto use this room as a place of business,\u201d he said, \u201cand these people\r\nare my clients.\u201d Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank\r\nquestion, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to\r\nconfide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for\r\nnot alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to\r\nthe subject of his own accord.\r\n\r\nIt was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I\r\nrose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not\r\nyet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my\r\nlate habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With\r\nthe unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt\r\nintimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table\r\nand attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched\r\nsilently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the\r\nheading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.\r\n\r\nIts somewhat ambitious title was \u201cThe Book of Life,\u201d and it attempted to\r\nshow how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic\r\nexamination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a\r\nremarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was\r\nclose and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched\r\nand exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch\r\nof a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man\u2019s inmost thoughts.\r\nDeceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one\r\ntrained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible\r\nas so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear\r\nto the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had\r\narrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom a drop of water,\u201d said the writer, \u201ca logician could infer the\r\npossibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of\r\none or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is\r\nknown whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,\r\nthe Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired\r\nby long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal\r\nto attain the highest possible perfection in it.

I don\u2019t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It\r\nis evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these\r\nneat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not\r\npractical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third class\r\ncarriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his\r\nfellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou would lose your money,\u201d Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. \u201cAs for\r\nthe article I wrote it myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The\r\ntheories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so\r\nchimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I depend\r\nupon them for my bread and cheese.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how?\u201d I asked involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the\r\nworld. I\u2019m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.\r\nHere in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private\r\nones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to\r\nput them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I\r\nam generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of\r\ncrime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about\r\nmisdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger\r\nends, it is odd if you can\u2019t unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade\r\nis a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a\r\nforgery case, and that was what brought him here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd these other people?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are\r\nall people who are in trouble about something, and want a little\r\nenlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and\r\nthen I pocket my fee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut do you mean to say,\u201d I said, \u201cthat without leaving your room you\r\ncan unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they\r\nhave seen every detail for themselves?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case\r\nturns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and\r\nsee things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge\r\nwhich I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully.\r\nThose rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your\r\nscorn, are invaluable to me in practical work.

Clearly in Afghanistan.\u2019 The\r\nwhole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you\r\ncame from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is simple enough as you explain it,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cYou remind\r\nme of Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s Dupin.

That trick of his of breaking\r\nin on his friends\u2019 thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of\r\nan hour\u2019s silence is really very showy and superficial.

That book made me positively ill. The question was\r\nhow to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four\r\nhours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for\r\ndetectives to teach them what to avoid.\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired\r\ntreated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood\r\nlooking out into the busy street. \u201cThis fellow may be very clever,\u201d I\r\nsaid to myself, \u201cbut he is certainly very conceited.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are no crimes and no criminals in these days,\u201d he said,\r\nquerulously. \u201cWhat is the use of having brains in our profession. I know\r\nwell that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has\r\never lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural\r\ntalent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the\r\nresult? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy\r\nwith a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see\r\nthrough it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it\r\nbest to change the topic.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder what that fellow is looking for?\u201d I asked, pointing to a\r\nstalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the\r\nother side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had\r\na large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean the retired sergeant of Marines,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrag and bounce!\u201d thought I to myself. \u201cHe knows that I cannot verify\r\nhis guess.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were\r\nwatching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across\r\nthe roadway.

SHERLOCK HOLMES,--\r\n\r\n\u201cThere has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens,\r\noff the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in\r\nthe morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something\r\nwas amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare\r\nof furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and\r\nhaving cards in his pocket bearing the name of \u2018Enoch J. Drebber,\r\nCleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.\u2019 There had been no robbery, nor is there any\r\nevidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of blood in\r\nthe room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a loss as to\r\nhow he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler.\r\nIf you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you will find\r\nme there. I have left everything _in statu quo_ until I hear from you.\r\nIf you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details, and would\r\nesteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion.\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\u201cTOBIAS GREGSON.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cGregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,\u201d my friend remarked;\r\n\u201che and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and\r\nenergetic, but conventional--shockingly so. They have their knives\r\ninto one another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional\r\nbeauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put\r\nupon the scent.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. \u201cSurely there is\r\nnot a moment to be lost,\u201d I cried, \u201cshall I go and order you a cab?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure about whether I shall go.

My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away\r\nabout Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and\r\nan Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the\r\nmelancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,\u201d I said at\r\nlast, interrupting Holmes\u2019 musical disquisition.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo data yet,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt is a capital mistake to theorize before\r\nyou have all the evidence.

Stop, driver, stop!\u201d We were still a hundred yards or so from\r\nit, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nNumber 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was\r\none of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being\r\noccupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant\r\nmelancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and\r\nthere a \u201cTo Let\u201d card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared\r\npanes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly\r\nplants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed\r\nby a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a\r\nmixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the\r\nrain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a\r\nthree-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and\r\nagainst this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by\r\na small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes\r\nin the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.\r\n\r\nI had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the\r\nhouse and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be\r\nfurther from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the\r\ncircumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up\r\nand down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the\r\nopposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny,\r\nhe proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass\r\nwhich flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice\r\nhe stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation\r\nof satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey\r\nsoil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was\r\nunable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it.\r\nStill I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his\r\nperceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal\r\nwhich was hidden from me.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,\r\nflaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and\r\nwrung my companion\u2019s hand with effusion. \u201cIt is indeed kind of you to\r\ncome,\u201d he said, \u201cI have had everything left untouched.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcept that!\u201d my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. \u201cIf a herd\r\nof buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No\r\ndoubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you\r\npermitted this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have had so much to do inside the house,\u201d the detective said\r\nevasively. \u201cMy colleague, Mr. Lestra'), NULL);

I had relied upon him\r\nto look after this.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. \u201cWith two\r\nsuch men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be\r\nmuch for a third party to find out,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nGregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. \u201cI think we have done\r\nall that can be done,\u201d he answered; \u201cit\u2019s a queer case though, and I\r\nknew your taste for such things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did not come here in a cab?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor Lestrade?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen let us go and look at the room.\u201d With which inconsequent remark he\r\nstrode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed\r\nhis astonishment.\r\n\r\nA short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices.\r\nTwo doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these\r\nhad obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the\r\ndining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had\r\noccurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling\r\nat my heart which the presence of death inspires.\r\n\r\nIt was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence\r\nof all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was\r\nblotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had\r\nbecome detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.\r\nOpposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of\r\nimitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a\r\nred wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was\r\nhazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was\r\nintensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.\r\n\r\nAll these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was\r\ncentred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon\r\nthe boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured\r\nceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of\r\nage, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and\r\na short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat\r\nand waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar\r\nand cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor\r\nbeside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while\r\nhis lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a\r\ngrievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,\r\nand as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human\r\nfeatures. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low\r\nforehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly\r\nsimious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing,\r\nunnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has\r\nit appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy\r\napartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nLestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and\r\ngreeted my companion and myself.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis case will make a stir, sir,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIt beats anything I\r\nhave seen, and I am no chicken.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no clue?\u201d said Gregson.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone at all,\u201d chimed in Lestrade.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it\r\nintently. \u201cYou are sure that there is no wound?\u201d he asked, pointing to\r\nnumerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.\r\n\r\n\u201cPositive!\u201d cried both detectives.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual--[8]\r\npresumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of\r\nthe circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in\r\nthe year \u201834. Do you remember the case, Gregson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRead it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun.

So swiftly was\r\nthe examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness\r\nwith which it was conducted.

At his call they entered\r\nthe room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised\r\nhim, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed\r\nit up and stared at it with mystified eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a woman here,\u201d he cried. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s wedding-ring.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered\r\nround him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of\r\nplain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis complicates matters,\u201d said Gregson. \u201cHeaven knows, they were\r\ncomplicated enough before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure it doesn\u2019t simplify them?\u201d observed Holmes. \u201cThere\u2019s\r\nnothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his\r\npockets?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have it all here,\u201d said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects\r\nupon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. \u201cA gold watch, No. 97163, by\r\nBarraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring,\r\nwith masonic device. Gold pin--bull-dog\u2019s head, with rubies as eyes.\r\nRussian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J.

They are both\r\nfrom the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their\r\nboats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to\r\nreturn to New York.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did it at once, sir,\u201d said Gregson. \u201cI have had advertisements\r\nsent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American\r\nExchange, but he has not returned yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you sent to Cleveland?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe telegraphed this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you word your inquiries?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad\r\nof any information which could help us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to\r\nbe crucial?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI asked about Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears\r\nto hinge? Will you not telegraph again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have said all I have to say,\u201d said Gregson, in an offended voice.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make\r\nsome remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we\r\nwere holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,\r\nrubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Gregson,\u201d he said, \u201cI have just made a discovery of the highest\r\nimportance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a\r\ncareful examination of the walls.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe little man\u2019s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in\r\na state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his\r\ncolleague.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of\r\nwhich felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. \u201cNow, stand\r\nthere!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at that!\u201d he said, triumphantly.\r\n\r\nI have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this\r\nparticular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a\r\nyellow square of coarse plastering.

The\r\nmurderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where\r\nit has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide\r\nanyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See\r\nthat candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was\r\nlit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of\r\nthe wall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?\u201d asked Gregson in a\r\ndepreciatory voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cMean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name\r\nRachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark\r\nmy words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a\r\nwoman named Rachel has something to do with it. It\u2019s all very well for\r\nyou to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but\r\nthe old hound is the best, when all is said and done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI really beg your pardon!\u201d said my companion, who had ruffled the\r\nlittle man\u2019s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. \u201cYou\r\ncertainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,\r\nand, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other\r\nparticipant in last night\u2019s mystery. I have not had time to examine this\r\nroom yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying\r\nglass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly\r\nabout the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once\r\nlying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that\r\nhe appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to\r\nhimself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire\r\nof exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of\r\nencouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded\r\nof a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and\r\nforwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes\r\nacross the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his\r\nresearches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between\r\nmarks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his\r\ntape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place\r\nhe gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor,\r\nand packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his glass\r\nthe word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most\r\nminute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he\r\nreplaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,\u201d he\r\nremarked with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad definition, but it does apply to\r\ndetective work.\u201d\r\n\r\nGregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres [9] of their amateur\r\ncompanion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently\r\nfailed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that\r\nSherlock Holmes\u2019 smallest actions were all directed towards some\r\ndefinite and practical end.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think of it, sir?\u201d they both asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume\r\nto help you,\u201d remarked my friend. \u201cYou are doing so well now that it\r\nwould be a pity for anyone to interfere.\u201d There was a world of\r\nsarcasm in his voice as he spoke. \u201cIf you will let me know how your\r\ninvestigations go,\u201d he continued, \u201cI shall be happy to give you any help\r\nI can.

He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had\r\nsmall feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a\r\nTrichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,\r\nwhich was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his\r\noff fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the\r\nfinger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long.

Sherlock\r\nHolmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a\r\nlong telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us\r\nto the address given us by Lestrade.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is nothing like first hand evidence,\u201d he remarked; \u201cas a matter\r\nof fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as\r\nwell learn all that is to be learned.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou amaze me, Holmes,\u201d said I. \u201cSurely you are not as sure as you\r\npretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no room for a mistake,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe very first thing\r\nwhich I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with\r\nits wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain\r\nfor a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must\r\nhave been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse\u2019s\r\nhoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than\r\nthat of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab\r\nwas there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the\r\nmorning--I have Gregson\u2019s word for that--it follows that it must have\r\nbeen there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two\r\nindividuals to the house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat seems simple enough,\u201d said I; \u201cbut how about the other man\u2019s\r\nheight?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from\r\nthe length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though\r\nthere is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow\u2019s stride\r\nboth on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of\r\nchecking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads\r\nhim to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just\r\nover six feet from the ground. It was child\u2019s play.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd his age?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest\r\neffort, he can\u2019t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth\r\nof a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across.\r\nPatent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.\r\nThere is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary\r\nlife a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I\r\nadvocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe finger nails and the Trichinopoly,\u201d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe writing on the wall was done with a man\u2019s forefinger dipped in\r\nblood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly\r\nscratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man\u2019s\r\nnail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor.\r\nIt was dark in colour and flakey--such an ash as is only made by a\r\nTrichinopoly.

You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.\u201d\r\n\r\nI passed my hand over my brow. \u201cMy head is in a whirl,\u201d I remarked; \u201cthe\r\nmore one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two\r\nmen--if there were two men--into an empty house? What has become of the\r\ncabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison?\r\nWhere did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer,\r\nsince robbery had no part in it? How came the woman\u2019s ring there? Above\r\nall, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before\r\ndecamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling\r\nall these facts.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy companion smiled approvingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,\u201d he\r\nsaid. \u201cThere is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up\r\nmy mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade\u2019s discovery it was simply\r\na blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting\r\nSocialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if\r\nyou noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real\r\nGerman invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely\r\nsay that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who\r\noverdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong\r\nchannel. I\u2019m not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You\r\nknow a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick,\r\nand if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the\r\nconclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall never do that,\u201d I answered; \u201cyou have brought detection as near\r\nan exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way\r\nin which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive\r\nto flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one other thing,\u201d he said. \u201cPatent leathers [10] and\r\nSquare-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway\r\ntogether as friendly as possible--arm-in-arm, in all probability.\r\nWhen they got inside they walked up and down the room--or rather,\r\nPatent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I\r\ncould read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he\r\ngrew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his\r\nstrides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt,\r\ninto a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I\u2019ve told you all I know myself\r\nnow, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working\r\nbasis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go to\r\nHalle\u2019s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way\r\nthrough a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the\r\ndingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Audley Court in there,\u201d he said, pointing to a narrow slit in\r\nthe line of dead-coloured brick. \u201cYou\u2019ll find me here when you come\r\nback.\u201d\r\n\r\nAudley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us\r\ninto a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings.

At eleven there was a fight at the \u2018White\r\nHart\u2019; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o\u2019clock it\r\nbegan to rain, and I met Harry Murcher--him who has the Holland Grove\r\nbeat--and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin\u2019.\r\nPresently--maybe about two or a little after--I thought I would take\r\na look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was\r\nprecious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down,\r\nthough a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin\u2019 down, thinkin\u2019\r\nbetween ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when\r\nsuddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same\r\nhouse. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty\r\non account of him that owns them who won\u2019t have the drains seen to,\r\nthough the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o\u2019 typhoid\r\nfever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in\r\nthe window, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the\r\ndoor----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,\u201d my companion\r\ninterrupted. \u201cWhat did you do that for?\u201d\r\n\r\nRance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost\r\namazement upon his features.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that\u2019s true, sir,\u201d he said; \u201cthough how you come to know it,\r\nHeaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and\r\nso lonesome, that I thought I\u2019d be none the worse for some one with me.\r\nI ain\u2019t afeared of anything on this side o\u2019 the grave; but I thought\r\nthat maybe it was him that died o\u2019 the typhoid inspecting the drains\r\nwhat killed him. The thought gave me a kind o\u2019 turn, and I walked back\r\nto the gate to see if I could see Murcher\u2019s lantern, but there wasn\u2019t no\r\nsign of him nor of anyone else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was no one in the street?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a livin\u2019 soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself\r\ntogether and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside,\r\nso I went into the room where the light was a-burnin\u2019. There was a\r\ncandle flickerin\u2019 on the mantelpiece--a red wax one--and by its light I\r\nsaw----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I know all that you saw.

Go on, though. What did you do next?\u201d\r\n\r\nRance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression.\r\n\u201cI went back to the gate and sounded my whistle.

After Holmes\u2019 departure for the concert, I\r\nlay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours\u2019 sleep.\r\nIt was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that\r\nhad occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into\r\nit. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted\r\nbaboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the\r\nimpression which that face had produced upon me that I found it\r\ndifficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its\r\nowner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most\r\nmalignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of\r\nCleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the\r\ndepravity of the victim was no condonment [11] in the eyes of the law.\r\n\r\nThe more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion\u2019s\r\nhypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he\r\nhad sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something\r\nwhich had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what\r\nhad caused the man\u2019s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of\r\nstrangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so\r\nthickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a st'), NULL);

As\r\nlong as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be\r\nno easy matter, either for Holmes or myself.

You\u2019re not looking quite\r\nyourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo tell the truth, it has,\u201d I said. \u201cI ought to be more case-hardened\r\nafter my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at\r\nMaiwand without losing my nerve.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\r\nimagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you\r\nseen the evening paper?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the\r\nfact that when the man was raised up, a woman\u2019s wedding ring fell upon\r\nthe floor. It is just as well it does not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at this advertisement,\u201d he answered. \u201cI had one sent to every\r\npaper this morning immediately after the affair.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. It\r\nwas the first announcement in the \u201cFound\u201d column. \u201cIn Brixton Road,\r\nthis morning,\u201d it ran, \u201ca plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway\r\nbetween the \u2018White Hart\u2019 Tavern and Holland Grove.

It\r\nis almost a facsimile.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who do you expect will answer this advertisement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, the man in the brown coat--our florid friend with the square toes.\r\nIf he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould he not consider it as too dangerous?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason\r\nto believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the\r\nring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber\u2019s\r\nbody, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the house he\r\ndiscovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already in\r\npossession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. He had\r\nto pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have\r\nbeen aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put yourself in that\r\nman\u2019s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to him\r\nthat it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving\r\nthe house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly look out for the\r\nevening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. His\r\neye, of course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should\r\nhe fear a trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding\r\nof the ring should be connected with the murder. He would come. He will\r\ncome. You shall see him within an hour?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you can leave me to deal with him then.

We\r\ncould not hear the servant\u2019s reply, but the door closed, and some one\r\nbegan to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling\r\none. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he\r\nlistened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feeble\r\ntap at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in,\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\nAt my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very\r\nold and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be\r\ndazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she\r\nstood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket\r\nwith nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face\r\nhad assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to\r\nkeep my countenance.\r\n\r\nThe old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our\r\nadvertisement. \u201cIt\u2019s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,\u201d she said,\r\ndropping another curtsey; \u201ca gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road.

Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it\r\nin addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I\r\nstill retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing\r\nupon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:--\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had\r\nseldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German\r\nname of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister\r\ninscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political\r\nrefugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in\r\nAmerica, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws,\r\nand been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht,\r\naqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian\r\ntheory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the\r\narticle concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer\r\nwatch over foreigners in England.\r\n\r\nThe _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort\r\nusually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the\r\nunsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening\r\nof all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had\r\nbeen residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the\r\nboarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell.\r\nHe was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph\r\nStangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the\r\n4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of\r\ncatching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon\r\nthe platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber\u2019s body\r\nwas, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road,\r\nmany miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are\r\nquestions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the\r\nwhereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and\r\nMr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it\r\nis confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily\r\nthrow light upon the matter.\r\n\r\nThe _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being\r\na political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated\r\nthe Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores\r\na number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not\r\nsoured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these\r\nmen there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was\r\npunished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary,\r\nStangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the\r\ndeceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address\r\nof the house at which he had boarded--a result which was entirely due to\r\nthe acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and\r\nthey appeared to afford him considerable amusement.\r\n\r\n\u201cI told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure\r\nto score.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat depends on how it turns out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, bless you, it doesn\u2019t matter in the least.

Will you have some whiskey and water?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d the detective answered. \u201cThe tremendous\r\nexertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn\r\nme out.

He is\r\nafter the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime\r\nthan the babe unborn.

Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf\r\nof my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this\r\nterrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however,\r\nthat in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be\r\ncompromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character, his\r\nprofession, his antecedents would all forbid it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,\u2019 I answered.\r\n\u2018Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,\u2019 she said, and her\r\ndaughter withdrew. \u2018Now, sir,\u2019 she continued, \u2018I had no intention of\r\ntelling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I\r\nhave no alternative.

Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but his\r\nemployer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise. He was coarse in his\r\nhabits and brutish in his ways. The very night of his arrival he became\r\nvery much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o\u2019clock in the\r\nday he could hardly ever be said to be sober.

When I closed the\r\ndoor behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in\r\nless than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr.\r\nDrebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for\r\ndrink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my\r\ndaughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train.\r\nHe then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her that\r\nshe should fly with him. \u201cYou are of age,\u201d he said, \u201cand there is no law\r\nto stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl\r\nhere, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a\r\nprincess.\u201d Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him,\r\nbut he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the\r\ndoor. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room.\r\nWhat happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the confused sounds\r\nof a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head.

This fresh development has shown me that I was\r\ncompletely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out\r\nwhat had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston\r\nStation about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in the\r\nmorning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question which\r\nconfronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between\r\n8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards.\r\nI telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning\r\nthem to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling\r\nupon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. You\r\nsee, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated,\r\nthe natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the\r\nvicinity for the night, and then to hang about the sta'), NULL);

I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making\r\nenquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and\r\nat eight o\u2019clock I reached Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, in Little George\r\nStreet. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there,\r\nthey at once answered me in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,\u2019 they said. \u2018He\r\nhas been waiting for a gentleman for two days.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where is he now?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I will go up and see him at once,\u2019 I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and\r\nlead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me\r\nthe room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor\r\nleading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to\r\ngo downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in\r\nspite of my twenty years\u2019 experience. From under the door there curled\r\na little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and\r\nformed a little pool along the skirting at the other side. I gave a cry,\r\nwhich brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The door\r\nwas locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it\r\nin. The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled\r\nup, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and had\r\nbeen for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned\r\nhim over, the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman\r\nwho had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause\r\nof death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated\r\nthe heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you\r\nsuppose was above the murdered man?\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror,\r\neven before Sherlock Holmes answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe word RACHE, written in letters of blood,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was it,\u201d said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all\r\nsilent for a while.\r\n\r\nThere was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the\r\ndeeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to\r\nhis crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle\r\ntingled as I thought of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man was seen,\u201d continued Lestrade. \u201cA milk boy, passing on his way\r\nto the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews\r\nat the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay\r\nthere, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which\r\nwas wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the\r\nladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to\r\nbe some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular\r\nnotice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him\r\nto be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish\r\nface, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in\r\nthe room some little time after the murder, for we found blood-stained\r\nwater in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the\r\nsheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.\u201d\r\n\r\nI glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which\r\ntallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of\r\nexultation or satisfaction upon his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the\r\nmurderer?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing. Stangerson had Drebber\u2019s purse in his pocket, but it seems\r\nthat this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd\r\npounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these\r\nextraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them.

I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand\r\nupon those pills?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have them,\u201d said Lestrade, producing a small white box; \u201cI took them\r\nand the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of\r\nsafety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking these\r\npills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to\r\nthem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive them here,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cNow, Doctor,\u201d turning to me, \u201care those\r\nordinary pills?\u201d\r\n\r\nThey certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small,\r\nround, and almost transparent against the light. \u201cFrom their lightness\r\nand transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,\u201d I\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so,\u201d answered Holmes. \u201cNow would you mind going down and\r\nfetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long,\r\nand which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\nI went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms. It\u2019s laboured\r\nbreathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end.\r\nIndeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded\r\nthe usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the\r\nrug.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will now cut one of these pills in two,\u201d said Holmes, and drawing his\r\npenknife he suited the action to the word. \u201cOne half we return into the\r\nbox for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass,\r\nin which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, the\r\nDoctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis may be very interesting,\u201d said Lestrade, in the injured tone of\r\none who suspects that he is being laughed at, \u201cI cannot see, however,\r\nwhat it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPatience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has\r\neverything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the\r\nmixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps\r\nit up readily enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and\r\nplaced it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock\r\nHolmes\u2019 earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in\r\nsilence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling\r\neffect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched\r\nupon tho [16] cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently\r\nneither the better nor the worse for its draught.\r\n\r\nHolmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without\r\nresult, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared\r\nupon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the\r\ntable, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience.

I have it!\u201d With a perfect shriek of delight he\r\nrushed to the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk,\r\nand presented it to the terrier.

Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly\r\npoison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that\r\nbefore ever I saw the box at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could\r\nhardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog,\r\nhowever, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me\r\nthat the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began\r\nto have a dim, vague perception of the truth.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll this seems strange to you,\u201d continued Holmes, \u201cbecause you failed\r\nat the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single\r\nreal clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize\r\nupon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to\r\nconfirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence\r\nof it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more\r\nobscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions.\r\nIt is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most\r\ncommonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no\r\nnew or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder\r\nwould have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of\r\nthe victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of\r\nthose _outr\u00e9_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered\r\nit remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more\r\ndifficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable\r\nimpatience, could contain himself no longer. \u201cLook here, Mr. Sherlock\r\nHolmes,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart\r\nman, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something\r\nmore than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking\r\nthe man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young\r\nCharpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade\r\nwent after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too.\r\nYou have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more\r\nthan we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to\r\nask you straight how much you do know of the business.

ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies\r\nan arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a\r\nbarrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to\r\nNebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado\r\nupon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature\r\nalways in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises\r\nsnow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are\r\nswift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged ca\u00f1ons; and there are\r\nenormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are\r\ngrey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common\r\ncharacteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.\r\n\r\nThere are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees\r\nor of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other\r\nhunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight\r\nof those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their\r\nprairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily\r\nthrough the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark\r\nravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These\r\nare the sole dwellers in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nIn the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from\r\nthe northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach\r\nstretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of\r\nalkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On\r\nthe extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks,\r\nwith their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of\r\ncountry there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life.\r\nThere is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull,\r\ngrey earth--above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may,\r\nthere is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but\r\nsilence--complete and heart-subduing silence.\r\n\r\nIt has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad\r\nplain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one\r\nsees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is\r\nlost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down\r\nby the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered\r\nwhite objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull\r\ndeposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some\r\nlarge and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have\r\nbelonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one\r\nmay trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those\r\nwho had fallen by the wayside.\r\n\r\nLooking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,\r\neighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance\r\nwas such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region.\r\nAn observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer\r\nto forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the brown\r\nparchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his\r\nlong, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; his\r\neyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; while\r\nthe hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a\r\nskeleton.

His gaunt face, however, and his clothes,\r\nwhich hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it\r\nwas that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man was\r\ndying--dying from hunger and from thirst.\r\n\r\nHe had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little\r\nelevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great\r\nsalt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage\r\nmountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might\r\nindicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there\r\nwas no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild\r\nquestioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to\r\nan end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. \u201cWhy\r\nnot here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,\u201d he muttered,\r\nas he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.\r\n\r\nBefore sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle,\r\nand also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carried\r\nslung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for\r\nhis strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some\r\nlittle violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little\r\nmoaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very\r\nbright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve hurt me!\u201d said a childish voice reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave I though,\u201d the man answered penitently, \u201cI didn\u2019t go for to do\r\nit.\u201d As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty\r\nlittle girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart\r\npink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother\u2019s care. The\r\nchild was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she\r\nhad suffered less than her companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is it now?\u201d he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the\r\ntowsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cKiss it and make it well,\u201d she said, with perfect gravity, shoving\r\n[19] the injured part up to him. \u201cThat\u2019s what mother used to do. Where\u2019s\r\nmother?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMother\u2019s gone. I guess you\u2019ll see her before long.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGone, eh!\u201d said the little girl. \u201cFunny, she didn\u2019t say good-bye; she\r\n\u2018most always did if she was just goin\u2019 over to Auntie\u2019s for tea, and now\r\nshe\u2019s been away three days. Say, it\u2019s awful dry, ain\u2019t it? Ain\u2019t there\r\nno water, nor nothing to eat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, there ain\u2019t nothing, dearie. You\u2019ll just need to be patient awhile,\r\nand then you\u2019ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like that, and\r\nthen you\u2019ll feel bullier.

Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little\r\nprattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face,\r\nand his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless\r\nheaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were\r\nface to face, while the two voices--the one thin and clear, the other\r\ndeep and harsh--united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness. The\r\nprayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder\r\nuntil the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her\r\nprotector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved\r\nto be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed\r\nhimself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the\r\ntired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the\r\nman\u2019s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion,\r\nand both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.\r\n\r\nHad the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight\r\nwould have met his eyes.

But what a caravan! When the head of it had reached the base\r\nof the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right\r\nacross the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons\r\nand carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who\r\nstaggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the\r\nwaggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently\r\nno ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had\r\nbeen compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new\r\ncountry. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and\r\nrumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels\r\nand the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to\r\nrouse the two tired wayfarers above them.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced\r\nmen, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles.

Amen!\u201d responded the whole party.\r\n\r\nThey were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and\r\nkeenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag\r\nabove them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink,\r\nshowing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight\r\nthere was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while\r\nfresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word\r\n\u2018Redskins\u2019 was on every lip.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere can\u2019t be any number of Injuns here,\u201d said the elderly man who\r\nappeared to be in command. \u201cWe have passed the Pawnees, and there are no\r\nother tribes until we cross the great mountains.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,\u201d asked one of the band.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I,\u201d \u201cand I,\u201d cried a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n\u201cLeave your horses below and we will await you here,\u201d the Elder\r\nanswered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their\r\nhorses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the\r\nobject which had excited their curiosity.

Beside him\r\nlay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brown\r\nsinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his\r\nvelveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of\r\nsnow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her infantile\r\nfeatures. Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and\r\nneat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long\r\nshrivelled members of her companion.

Many were the cries\r\nof astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they\r\nperceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the\r\nother. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by\r\na great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was\r\nconspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of\r\nits appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were\r\nfurnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there\r\nsat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but\r\nwhose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader.

From the\r\nshores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains\r\nthey had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history.\r\nThe savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and\r\ndisease--every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all\r\nbeen overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and the\r\naccumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them.\r\nThere was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer\r\nwhen they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath\r\nthem, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the\r\npromised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for\r\nevermore.\r\n\r\nYoung speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a\r\nresolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future\r\ncity was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and allotted in\r\nproportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put\r\nto his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets and\r\nsquares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was draining\r\nand hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole\r\ncountry golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strange\r\nsettlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the\r\ncentre of the city grew ever taller and larger. From the first blush of\r\ndawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer\r\nand the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the\r\nimmigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers.\r\n\r\nThe two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his\r\nfortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons\r\nto the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne\r\nalong pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson\u2019s waggon, a retreat which\r\nshe shared with the Mormon\u2019s three wives and with his son, a headstrong\r\nforward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood,\r\nfrom the shock caused by her mother\u2019s death, she soon became a pet\r\nwith the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving\r\ncanvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his\r\nprivations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable\r\nhunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that\r\nwhen they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed\r\nthat he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land\r\nas any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of\r\nStangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal\r\nElders.\r\n\r\nOn the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial\r\nlog-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it\r\ngrew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind,\r\nkeen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution\r\nenabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his\r\nlands.

In three years he was better off than his\r\nneighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelve\r\nthere were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could\r\ncompare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch\r\nMountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier.\r\n\r\nThere was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities\r\nof his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him\r\nto set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. He\r\nnever gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by\r\nresolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. There were some\r\nwho accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who\r\nput it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others,\r\nagain, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who\r\nhad pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason,\r\nFerrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed\r\nto the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an\r\northodox and straight-walking man.\r\n\r\nLucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted\r\nfather in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the\r\nbalsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to\r\nthe young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger,\r\nher cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon\r\nthe high road which ran by Ferrier\u2019s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts\r\nrevive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping\r\nthrough the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father\u2019s mustang,\r\nand managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West.\r\nSo the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father\r\nthe richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American\r\ngirlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.\r\n\r\nIt was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had\r\ndeveloped into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious\r\nchange is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of\r\nall does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the\r\ntouch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns,\r\nwith a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has\r\nawoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember\r\nthe one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. In the\r\ncase of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart\r\nfrom its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides.\r\n\r\nIt was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as\r\nthe bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields and\r\nin the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high\r\nroads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the\r\nwest, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland\r\nRoute lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves of\r\nsheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains\r\nof tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable\r\njourney. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the\r\nskill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair\r\nface flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out\r\nbehind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and was\r\ndashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness\r\nof youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The\r\ntravel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even\r\nthe unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their\r\naccustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced\r\nmaiden.\r\n\r\nShe had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road\r\nblocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a ha'), NULL);

In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this\r\nobstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely\r\nhad she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind\r\nher, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of\r\nfierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with\r\ncattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of\r\nevery opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way\r\nthrough the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures,\r\neither by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of\r\nthe mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon\r\nits hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that\r\nwould have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full\r\nof peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns\r\nagain, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could\r\ndo to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death\r\nunder the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals.

Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the\r\nstruggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair,\r\nbut for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At\r\nthe same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by\r\nthe curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the\r\noutskirts.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not hurt, I hope, miss,\u201d said her preserver, respectfully.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. \u201cI\u2019m awful\r\nfrightened,\u201d she said, naively; \u201cwhoever would have thought that Poncho\r\nwould have been so scared by a lot of cows?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank God you kept your seat,\u201d the other said earnestly. He was a tall,\r\nsavage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and\r\nclad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his\r\nshoulders. \u201cI guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,\u201d he remarked,\r\n\u201cI saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask him if he\r\nremembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis.

The love which had sprung up in\r\nhis heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the\r\nwild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper. He\r\nhad been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in\r\nhis heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human\r\nperseverance could render him successful.\r\n\r\nHe called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until\r\nhis face was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the\r\nvalley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning\r\nthe news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this\r\nJefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested\r\nLucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and\r\ncould narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost\r\nin those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a\r\nsilver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to be\r\nhad, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a\r\nfavourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On\r\nsuch occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright,\r\nhappy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer\r\nher own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms,\r\nbut they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nIt was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled\r\nup at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He\r\nthrew the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am off, Lucy,\u201d he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing\r\ntenderly down into her face; \u201cI won\u2019t ask you to come with me now, but\r\nwill you be ready to come when I am here again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd when will that be?\u201d she asked, blushing and laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cA couple of months at the outside.

She stood at the gate, gazing after him until\r\nhe vanished from her sight.

John Ferrier\u2019s heart was sore within him\r\nwhen he thought of the young man\u2019s return, and of the impending loss of\r\nhis adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to\r\nthe arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always\r\ndetermined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever\r\ninduce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he\r\nregarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever\r\nhe might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was\r\ninflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to\r\nexpress an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in\r\nthe Land of the Saints.\r\n\r\nYes, a dangerous matter--so dangerous that even the most saintly dared\r\nonly whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest someth'), NULL);

The victims of persecution had now turned\r\npersecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most\r\nterrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German\r\nVehm-gericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put\r\na more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over\r\nthe State of Utah.\r\n\r\nIts invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made\r\nthis organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and\r\nomnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out\r\nagainst the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or\r\nwhat had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home,\r\nbut no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the\r\nhands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed\r\nby annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this\r\nterrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men\r\nwent about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the\r\nwilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.\r\n\r\nAt first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the\r\nrecalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards\r\nto pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The\r\nsupply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female\r\npopulation on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange\r\nrumours began to be bandied about--rumours of murdered immigrants and\r\nrifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women\r\nappeared in the harems of the Elders--women who pined and wept, and\r\nbore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated\r\nwanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked,\r\nstealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These\r\ntales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and\r\nre-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.\r\nTo this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite\r\nBand, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.\r\n\r\nFuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible\r\nresults served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it\r\ninspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless\r\nsociety. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and\r\nviolence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.\r\nThe very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the\r\nProphet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at\r\nnight with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every\r\nman feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were\r\nnearest his heart.\r\n\r\nOne fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields,\r\nwhen he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window,\r\nsaw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His\r\nheart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham\r\nYoung himself. Full of trepidation--for he knew that such a visit boded\r\nhim little good--Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. The\r\nlatter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with\r\na stern face into the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrother Ferrier,\u201d he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly\r\nfrom under his light-coloured eyelashes, \u201cthe true believers have been\r\ngood friends to you.

Is not this so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is so,\u201d answered John Ferrier.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you\r\nshould embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages.\r\nThis you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you hav'), NULL);

This must be the gossip of idle tongues.\r\nWhat is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith?\r\n\u2018Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if\r\nshe wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.\u2019 This being so, it is\r\nimpossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your\r\ndaughter to violate it.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his\r\nriding-whip.\r\n\r\n\u201cUpon this one point your whole faith shall be tested--so it has been\r\ndecided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would\r\nnot have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all\r\nchoice. We Elders have many heifers, [29] but our children must also\r\nbe provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of\r\nthem would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose\r\nbetween them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say\r\nyou to that?\u201d\r\n\r\nFerrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will give us time,\u201d he said at last. \u201cMy daughter is very\r\nyoung--she is scarce of an age to marry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe shall have a month to choose,\u201d said Young, rising from his seat.\r\n\u201cAt the end of that time she shall give her answer.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and\r\nflashing eyes. \u201cIt were better for you, John Ferrier,\u201d he thundered,\r\n\u201cthat you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra\r\nBlanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of\r\nthe Holy Four!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and\r\nFerrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.\r\n\r\nHe was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he\r\nshould broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon\r\nhis, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her\r\npale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI could not help it,\u201d she said, in answer to his look. \u201cHis voice rang\r\nthrough the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you scare yourself,\u201d he answered, drawing her to him, and passing\r\nhis broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair. \u201cWe\u2019ll fix it\r\nup somehow or another.

In it he told the young man of the\r\nimminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he\r\nshould return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returned\r\nhome with a lighter heart.\r\n\r\nAs he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to\r\neach of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering\r\nto find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a\r\nlong pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet\r\ncocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse\r\nbloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in\r\nhis pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as\r\nhe entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know us,\u201d he said. \u201cThis here is the son of Elder\r\nDrebber, and I\u2019m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert\r\nwhen the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true\r\nfold.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs He will all the nations in His own good time,\u201d said the other in a\r\nnasal voice; \u201cHe grindeth slowly but exceeding small.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have come,\u201d continued Stangerson, \u201cat the advice of our fathers to\r\nsolicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to\r\nyou and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has\r\nseven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, nay, Brother Stangerson,\u201d cried the other; \u201cthe question is not\r\nhow many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now\r\ngiven over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut my prospects are better,\u201d said the other, warmly. \u201cWhen the\r\nLord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather\r\nfactory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will be for the maiden to decide,\u201d rejoined young Drebber, smirking\r\nat his own reflection in the glass. \u201cWe will leave it all to her\r\ndecision.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway,\r\nhardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here,\u201d he said at last, striding up to them, \u201cwhen my daughter\r\nsummons you, you can come, but until then I don\u2019t want to see your faces\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two young Mormons stared at him in amazement.

Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses\u2019\r\nhoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe young canting rascals!\u201d he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from\r\nhis forehead; \u201cI would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the\r\nwife of either of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so should I, father,\u201d she answered, with spirit; \u201cbut Jefferson\r\nwill soon be here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we\r\ndo not know what their next move may be.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and\r\nhelp should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted\r\ndaughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been\r\nsuch a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If\r\nminor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this\r\narch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no\r\navail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been\r\nspirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He\r\nwas a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which\r\nhung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but\r\nthis suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter,\r\nhowever, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she,\r\nwith the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.\r\n\r\nHe expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from\r\nYoung as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an\r\nunlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise,\r\na small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over\r\nhis chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:--\r\n\r\n\u201cTwenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then----\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How\r\nthis warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his\r\nservants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been\r\nsecured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but\r\nthe incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were\r\nevidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What\r\nstrength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such\r\nmysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck\r\nhim to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.\r\n\r\nStill more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their\r\nbreakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the\r\ncentre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently,\r\nthe number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not\r\nenlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and\r\nward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had\r\nbeen painted upon the outside of his door.\r\n\r\nThus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his\r\nunseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some\r\nconspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the\r\nmonth of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls,\r\nsometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards\r\nstuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John\r\nFerrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A\r\n'), NULL);

He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled look\r\nof some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that was\r\nfor the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada.\r\n\r\nTwenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news\r\nof the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there\r\ncame no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a\r\ndriver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking\r\nthat help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to\r\nfour and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of\r\nescape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains\r\nwhich surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The\r\nmore-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could\r\npass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he\r\nwould, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him.\r\nYet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself\r\nbefore he consented to what he regarded as his daughter\u2019s dishonour.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and\r\nsearching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the\r\nfigure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last\r\nof the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague and\r\nterrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter--what was to\r\nbecome of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the invisible\r\nnetwork which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the table\r\nand sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.\r\n\r\nWhat was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound--low,\r\nbut very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of\r\nthe house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There\r\nwas a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was\r\nrepeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the\r\npanels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry\r\nout the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent\r\nwho was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier\r\nfelt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook\r\nhis nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and\r\nthrew the door open.\r\n\r\nOutside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were\r\ntwinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the\r\nfarmer\u2019s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on\r\nthe road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier\r\nlooked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at\r\nhis own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face\r\nupon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.\r\n\r\nSo unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with\r\nhis hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first\r\nthought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying\r\nman, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the\r\nhall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the\r\nhouse the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the\r\nastonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson\r\nHope.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood God!\u201d gasped John Ferrier. \u201cHow you scared me!

He had\r\nhardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his\r\ndaughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the\r\nlovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was\r\nmuch to be done.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must make our start at once,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low\r\nbut resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril,\r\nbut has steeled his heart to meet it. \u201cThe front and back entrances are\r\nwatched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and\r\nacross the fields.

By daybreak we should be half-way\r\nthrough the mountains.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat if we are stopped,\u201d asked Ferrier.\r\n\r\nHope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his\r\ntunic. \u201cIf they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them\r\nwith us,\u201d he said with a sinister smile.\r\n\r\nThe lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the\r\ndarkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own,\r\nand which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved\r\nhimself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and\r\nhappiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes.\r\nAll looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad\r\nsilent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that\r\nthe spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set\r\nexpression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house\r\nhe had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.\r\n\r\nFerrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty\r\nprovisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few\r\nof her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and\r\ncarefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the\r\nnight, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With\r\nbated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained\r\nthe shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap\r\nwhich opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when\r\nthe young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the\r\nshadow, where they lay silent and trembling.\r\n\r\nIt was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the\r\nears of a lynx.

Their concluding words had evidently been some\r\nform of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died\r\naway in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his\r\ncompanions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top\r\nof his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength\r\nappeared to fail her.\r\n\r\n\u201cHurry on! hurry on!\u201d he gasped from time to time. \u201cWe are through the\r\nline of sentinels.

Only once did they\r\nmeet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid\r\nrecognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a\r\nrugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged\r\npeaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led\r\nbetween them was the Eagle Ca\u00f1on in which the horses were awaiting them.\r\nWith unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great\r\nboulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he came to\r\nthe retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had\r\nbeen picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon\r\none of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the\r\nother along the precipitous and dangerous path.\r\n\r\nIt was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face\r\nNature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a\r\nthousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic\r\ncolumns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster.\r\nOn the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance\r\nimpossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places\r\nthat they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised\r\nriders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of all dangers and\r\ndifficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them,\r\nfor every step increased the distance between them and the terrible\r\ndespotism from which they were flying.\r\n\r\nThey soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the\r\njurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most\r\ndesolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and\r\npointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark\r\nand plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them\r\nas soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of \u201cWho goes\r\nthere?\u201d rang through the silent ravine.\r\n\r\n\u201cTravellers for Nevada,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the\r\nrifle which hung by his saddle.\r\n\r\nThey could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at\r\nthem as if dissatisfied at their reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy whose permission?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Holy Four,\u201d answered Ferrier.

In every direction the great snow-capped peaks\r\nhemmed them in, peeping over each other\u2019s shoulders to the far horizon.\r\nSo steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch\r\nand the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a\r\ngust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely\r\nan illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and\r\nboulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed,\r\na great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke\r\nthe echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a\r\ngallop.\r\n\r\nAs the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great\r\nmountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until\r\nthey were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the\r\nhearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild\r\ntorrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their\r\nhorses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father\r\nwould fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. \u201cThey\r\nwill be upon our track by this time,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything depends upon\r\nour speed.

At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag,\r\nwhere the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there\r\nhuddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours\u2019 sleep. Before\r\ndaybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had\r\nseen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that\r\nthey were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose\r\nenmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could\r\nreach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store\r\nof provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness,\r\nhowever, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had\r\nfrequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life.\r\nChoosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and\r\nmade a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for\r\nthey were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air\r\nwas bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu,\r\nhe threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever\r\nchance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man and the\r\nyoung girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals\r\nstood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them\r\nfrom his view.\r\n\r\nHe walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without\r\nsuccess, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other\r\nindications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity.\r\nAt last, after two or three hours\u2019 fruitless search, he was thinking of\r\nturning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight\r\nwhich sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a\r\njutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a\r\ncreature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a\r\npair of gigantic horns. The big-horn--for so it is called--was acting,\r\nprobably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter;\r\nbut fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not\r\nperceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and\r\ntook a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger.

With this trophy\r\nover his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was\r\nalready drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realized\r\nthe difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far\r\npast the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter\r\nto pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found\r\nhimself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like\r\neach other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other.\r\nHe followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent\r\nwhich he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had\r\ntaken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night\r\nwas coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found\r\nhimself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy\r\nmatter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and\r\nthe high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed\r\ndown with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along,\r\nkeeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him\r\nnearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food\r\nfor the remainder of their journey.\r\n\r\nHe had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left\r\nthem. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs\r\nwhich bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously,\r\nfor he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart\r\nhe put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo\r\nas a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer.\r\nNone came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent\r\nravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again\r\nhe shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from\r\nthe friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless\r\ndread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the\r\nprecious food in his agitation.\r\n\r\nWhen he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the\r\nfire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there,\r\nbut it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same\r\ndead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to\r\nconvictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the\r\nremains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only\r\ntoo clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during\r\nhis absence--a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no\r\ntraces behind it.\r\n\r\nBewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin\r\nround, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He\r\nwas essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from\r\nhis temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the\r\nsmouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help\r\nto examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet\r\nof horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken\r\nthe fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had\r\nafterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of\r\nhis companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself\r\nthat they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made\r\nevery nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of\r\nthe camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly\r\nnot been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a\r\nnewly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a\r\nstick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft\r\nfork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point:\r\n\r\n                        JOHN FERRIER,\r\n                 FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, [22]\r\n                    Died August 4th, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe sturdy old man, whom he '), NULL);

Jefferson Hope looked wildly round\r\nto see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy\r\nhad been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original\r\ndestiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder\u2019s son. As the young\r\nfellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to\r\nprevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his\r\nlast silent resting-place.\r\n\r\nAgain, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs\r\nfrom despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least\r\ndevote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance,\r\nJefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which\r\nhe may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he\r\nstood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could\r\nassuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought\r\nby his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy\r\nshould, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white\r\nface, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having\r\nstirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a\r\nfew days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he\r\nset himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the\r\navenging angels.\r\n\r\nFor five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he\r\nhad already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among\r\nthe rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was\r\nalways well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Ca\u00f1on,\r\nfrom which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he could\r\nlook down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned\r\nupon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent\r\nwidespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that\r\nthere were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of\r\nfestivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he\r\nheard the clatter of horse\u2019s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towards\r\nhim. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to\r\nwhom he had rendered services at different times. He therefore accosted\r\nhim when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy\r\nFerrier\u2019s fate had been.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Jefferson Hope,\u201d he said. \u201cYou remember me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment--indeed, it was\r\ndifficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly\r\nwhite face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former\r\ndays. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity,\r\nthe man\u2019s surprise changed to consternation.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are mad to come here,\u201d he cried. \u201cIt is as much as my own life is\r\nworth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from\r\nthe Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t fear them, or their warrant,\u201d Hope said, earnestly. \u201cYou must\r\nknow something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you\r\nhold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For\r\nGod\u2019s sake, don\u2019t refuse to answer me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the Mormon asked uneasily. \u201cBe quick. The very rocks have\r\nears and the trees eyes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat has become of Lucy Ferrier?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you\r\nhave no life left in you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and\r\nhad sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. \u201cMarried,\r\nyou say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMarried yesterday--that\u2019s what those flags are for on the Endowment\r\nHouse. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson\r\nas to which was to have her. They\u2019d both been in the party that followed\r\nthem, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the\r\nbest claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber\u2019s party was\r\nthe stronger, '), NULL);

His\r\nface might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its\r\nexpression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder,\r\nstrode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to\r\nthe haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce\r\nand so dangerous as himself.\r\n\r\nThe prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was\r\nthe terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage\r\ninto which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again,\r\nbut pined away and died within a month. Her sottish husband, who had\r\nmarried her principally for the sake of John Ferrier\u2019s property, did not\r\naffect any great grief at his bereavement; but his other wives mourned\r\nover her, and sat up with her the night before the burial, as is the\r\nMormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of\r\nthe morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment,\r\nthe door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in\r\ntattered garments strode into the room. Without a glance or a word to\r\nthe cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had\r\nonce contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he\r\npressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching\r\nup her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her finger. \u201cShe shall not be\r\nburied in that,\u201d he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could\r\nbe raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief\r\nwas the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to believe\r\nit themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the\r\nundeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been\r\na bride had disappeared.\r\n\r\nFor some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading\r\na strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for\r\nvengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird\r\nfigure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted\r\nthe lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson\u2019s\r\nwindow and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On\r\nanother occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder\r\ncrashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing\r\nhimself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in\r\ndiscovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led\r\nrepeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or\r\nkilling their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the\r\nprecaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having\r\ntheir houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these\r\nmeasures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and\r\nthey hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.\r\n\r\nFar from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter\u2019s mind\r\nwas of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge\r\nhad taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for\r\nany other emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon\r\nrealized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant\r\nstrain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome food\r\nwere wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains, what\r\nwas to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure to\r\novertake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his enemy\u2019s\r\ngame, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there to\r\nrecruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his\r\nobject without privation.\r\n\r\nHis intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a\r\ncom'), NULL);

At the end of that time, however, his memory of\r\nhis wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that\r\nmemorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier\u2019s grave. Disguised,\r\nand under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless\r\nwhat became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to\r\nbe justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a\r\nschism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger\r\nmembers of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the\r\nElders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the\r\nmalcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been\r\nDrebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour\r\nreported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his\r\nproperty into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his\r\ncompanion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at all,\r\nhowever, as to their whereabouts.\r\n\r\nMany a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of\r\nrevenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never\r\nfaltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out\r\nby such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town\r\nthrough the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into\r\nyear, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human\r\nbloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he\r\nhad devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was\r\nbut a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that\r\nCleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He\r\nreturned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all\r\narranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window,\r\nhad recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in\r\nhis eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by\r\nStangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him\r\nthat they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of\r\nan old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and\r\nnot being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. When at\r\nlast he was liberated, it was only to find that Drebber\u2019s house was\r\ndeserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe.\r\n\r\nAgain the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred\r\nurged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and\r\nfor some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his\r\napproaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in\r\nhim, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to\r\ncity, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the\r\nfugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris;\r\nand when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off\r\nfor Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for\r\nthey had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running\r\nthem to earth.

We were ushered into\r\na small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner\u2019s name\r\nand the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged. The\r\nofficial was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his\r\nduties in a dull mechanical way. \u201cThe prisoner will be put before the\r\nmagistrates in the course of the week,\u201d he said; \u201cin the mean time, Mr.\r\nJefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you\r\nthat your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a good deal to say,\u201d our prisoner said slowly. \u201cI want to tell\r\nyou gentlemen all about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHadn\u2019t you better reserve that for your trial?\u201d asked the Inspector.\r\n\r\n\u201cI may never be tried,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou needn\u2019t look startled.

The walls of his chest seemed to\r\nthrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful\r\nengine was at work.

It has been getting worse for years. I got it from over-exposure\r\nand under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains.

When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found\r\nthat I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding\r\nare as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner\u2019s office,\r\nand soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to the\r\nowner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There was\r\nseldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The hardest job\r\nwas to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever\r\nwere contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had a map beside me\r\nthough, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, I\r\ngot on pretty well.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living;\r\nbut I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They\r\nwere at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the\r\nriver. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I\r\nhad grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me.\r\nI would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I was\r\ndetermined that they should not escape me again.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about\r\nLondon, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my\r\ncab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they\r\ncould not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late\r\nat night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand\r\nwith my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay\r\nmy hand upon the men I wanted.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was\r\nsome chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone,\r\nand never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every\r\nday, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half\r\nthe time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them\r\nlate and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not\r\ndiscouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My\r\nonly fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon\r\nand leave my work undone.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the\r\nstreet was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to\r\ntheir door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time\r\nDrebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off.

I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear\r\nevery word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little\r\nbusiness of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he\r\nwould soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded\r\nhim that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the\r\nmatter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch\r\nwhat Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and\r\nreminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he\r\nmust not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it up\r\nas a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last\r\ntrain he should rejoin him at Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel; to which Drebber\r\nanswered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made\r\nhis way out of the station.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my\r\nenemies within my power. Together they could protect each other,\r\nbut singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue\r\nprecipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction in\r\nvengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes\r\nhim, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by\r\nwhich I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me\r\nunderstand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some days\r\nbefore a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in\r\nthe Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It\r\nwas claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had\r\ntaken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means of\r\nthis I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could\r\nrely upon being free from interruption.

I followed it so close\r\nthat the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way.\r\nWe rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until,\r\nto my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he\r\nhad boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in returning\r\nthere; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from\r\nthe house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away.

One day the professor was\r\nlecturing on poisions, [25] and he showed his students some alkaloid,\r\nas he called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow\r\npoison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant\r\ndeath. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when\r\nthey were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly\r\ngood dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and\r\neach pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison.\r\nI determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should\r\neach have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that\r\nremained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than\r\nfiring across a handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes\r\nabout with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard\r\nand raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within--so\r\nglad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you\r\ngentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty\r\nlong years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would\r\nunderstand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my\r\nnerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with\r\nexcitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy\r\nlooking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I\r\nsee you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on each\r\nside of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the\r\ndripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber\r\nall huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, \u2018It\u2019s\r\ntime to get out,\u2019 I said.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018All right, cabby,\u2019 said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned,\r\nfor he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden.\r\nI had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little\r\ntop-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the\r\nfront room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the\r\ndaughter were walking in front of us.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s infernally dark,\u2019 said he, stamping about.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018We\u2019ll soon have a light,\u2019 I said, striking a match and putting it to\r\na wax candle which I had brought with me. \u2018Now, Enoch Drebber,\u2019 I\r\ncontinued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, \u2018who am\r\nI?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I\r\nsaw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which\r\nshowed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I\r\nsaw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered\r\nin his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughed\r\nloud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I\r\nhad never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You dog!\u2019 I said; \u2018I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.\r\nPetersburg, and you have always es'), NULL);

Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled\r\nby chance.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my\r\nknife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed\r\nthe other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or\r\nmore, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Shall I\r\never forget the look which came over his face when the first warning\r\npangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as I saw\r\nit, and held Lucy\u2019s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was but for\r\na moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of pain\r\ncontorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him,\r\nstaggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I\r\nturned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There\r\nwas no movement. He was dead!\r\n\r\n\u201cThe blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of\r\nit. I don\u2019t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the\r\nwall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police\r\nupon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I remembered\r\na German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him, and it\r\nwas argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must\r\nhave done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle\r\nthe Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on\r\na convenient place on the wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found\r\nthat there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild. I\r\nhad driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which\r\nI usually kept Lucy\u2019s ring, and found that it was not there. I was\r\nthunderstruck at this, for it was the only memento that I had of her.\r\nThinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber\u2019s\r\nbody, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly\r\nup to the house--for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose\r\nthe ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of a\r\npolice-officer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm his\r\nsuspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was\r\nto do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier\u2019s debt. I knew\r\nthat he was staying at Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, and I hung about all\r\nday, but he never came out.

Instead of grasping at the chance of\r\nsafety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my\r\nthroat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart.

In solving a problem of this\r\nsort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very\r\nuseful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise\r\nit much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason\r\nforwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who\r\ncan reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI confess,\u201d said I, \u201cthat I do not quite follow you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer.\r\nMost people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you\r\nwhat the result would be. They can put those events together in their\r\nminds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are\r\nfew people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to\r\nevolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led\r\nup to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning\r\nbackwards, or analytically.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow this was a case in which you were given the result and had to\r\nfind everything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the\r\ndifferent steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached\r\nthe house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all\r\nimpressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I\r\nhave already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which,\r\nI ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. I\r\nsatisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the\r\nnarrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerably\r\nless wide than a gentleman\u2019s brougham.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden\r\npath, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable\r\nfor taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere\r\ntrampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its\r\nsurface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which\r\nis so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.\r\nHappily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice\r\nhas made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the\r\nconstables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed\r\nthrough the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the\r\nothers, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by\r\nthe others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was\r\nformed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number,\r\none remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the length of his\r\nstride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and\r\nelegant impression left by his boots.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted\r\nman lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder\r\nthere was. There was no wound upon the dead man\u2019s person, but the\r\nagitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his\r\nfate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or any\r\nsudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their\r\nfeatures. Having sniffed the dead man\u2019s lips I detected a slightly sour\r\nsmell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon\r\nhim. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred\r\nand fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had\r\narrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts.\r\nDo not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible\r\nadministration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals.\r\nThe cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will\r\noccur at once to any toxicologist.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now came the great question as to the'), NULL);
INSERT INTO SYSTEM_LOB_STREAM VALUES(0, 58, STRINGDECODE(' reason why. Robbery had not\r\nbeen the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics,\r\nthen, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me.\r\nI was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political\r\nassassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder\r\nhad, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator\r\nhad left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there\r\nall the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political\r\none, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription\r\nwas discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my\r\nopinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found,\r\nhowever, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to\r\nremind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point\r\nthat I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to\r\nCleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber\u2019s former career. He\r\nanswered, you remember, in the negative.\r\n\r\n\u201cI then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which\r\nconfirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer\u2019s height, and furnished me\r\nwith the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length\r\nof his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no\r\nsigns of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst\r\nfrom the murderer\u2019s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that the\r\ntrack of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that\r\nany man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through\r\nemotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a\r\nrobust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly.\r\n\r\n\u201cHaving left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I\r\ntelegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry\r\nto the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The\r\nanswer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for\r\nthe protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson\r\nHope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that\r\nI held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to\r\nsecure the murderer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked\r\ninto the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven\r\nthe cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered\r\non in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in\r\ncharge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside\r\nthe house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry\r\nout a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third\r\nperson, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished\r\nto dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than\r\nto turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible\r\nconclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the\r\nMetropolis.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to\r\nbe. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be\r\nlikely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time at\r\nleast, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose\r\nthat he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change his name\r\nin a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore organized\r\nmy Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every\r\ncab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted.\r\nHow well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are\r\nstill fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was an\r\nincident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in\r\nany case have been prevented.

They consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings. Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion. As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments. The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it. He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question, confirmed Stamford\u2019s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me.

His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it. \u201cYou appear to be astonished,\u201d he said, smiling at my expression of surprise. \u201cNow that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it. \u201d \u201cTo forget it! \u201d \u201cYou see,\u201d he explained, \u201cI consider that a man\u2019s brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones. \u201d \u201cBut the Solar System! \u201d I protested. \u201cWhat the deuce is it to me? \u201d he interrupted impatiently; \u201cyou say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work. \u201d I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I pondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down. I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ran in this way-- SHERLOCK HOLMES--his limits. 1. Knowledge of Literature. --Nil. 2. Philosophy. --Nil. 3. Astronomy. --Nil. 4.

These were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments.

Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience. During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently, however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most different classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came three or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely followed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room. He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. \u201cI have to use this room as a place of business,\u201d he said, \u201cand these people are my clients. \u201d Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord. It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it. Its somewhat ambitious title was \u201cThe Book of Life,\u201d and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man\u2019s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer. \u201cFrom a drop of water,\u201d said the writer, \u201ca logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it.

Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man\u2019s finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man\u2019s calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable. \u201d \u201cWhat ineffable twaddle! \u201d I cried, slapping the magazine down on the table, \u201cI never read such rubbish in my life. \u201d \u201cWhat is it? \u201d asked Sherlock Holmes. \u201cWhy, this article,\u201d I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat down to my breakfast. \u201cI see that you have read it since you have marked it. I don\u2019t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him. \u201d \u201cYou would lose your money,\u201d Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. \u201cAs for the article I wrote it myself. \u201d \u201cYou! \u201d \u201cYes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I depend upon them for my bread and cheese. \u201d \u201cAnd how? \u201d I asked involuntarily. \u201cWell, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I\u2019m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you can\u2019t unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what brought him here. \u201d \u201cAnd these other people? \u201d \u201cThey are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my fee. \u201d \u201cBut do you mean to say,\u201d I said, \u201cthat without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen every detail for themselves? \u201d \u201cQuite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan. \u201d \u201cYou were told, no doubt. \u201d \u201cNothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, \u2018Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army doctor, then.

I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished. \u201d \u201cIt is simple enough as you explain it,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cYou remind me of Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories. \u201d Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. \u201cNo doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,\u201d he observed. \u201cNow, in my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking in on his friends\u2019 thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour\u2019s silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine. \u201d \u201cHave you read Gaboriau\u2019s works? \u201d I asked. \u201cDoes Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective? \u201d Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. \u201cLecoq was a miserable bungler,\u201d he said, in an angry voice; \u201che had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid. \u201d I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired treated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood looking out into the busy street. \u201cThis fellow may be very clever,\u201d I said to myself, \u201cbut he is certainly very conceited. \u201d \u201cThere are no crimes and no criminals in these days,\u201d he said, querulously. \u201cWhat is the use of having brains in our profession. I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it. \u201d I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it best to change the topic. \u201cI wonder what that fellow is looking for? \u201d I asked, pointing to a stalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a message. \u201cYou mean the retired sergeant of Marines,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cBrag and bounce! \u201d thought I to myself. \u201cHe knows that I cannot verify his guess. \u201d The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across the roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps ascending the stair. \u201cFor Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d he said, stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter. Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little thought of this when he made that random shot. \u201cMay I ask, my lad,\u201d I said, in the blandest voice, \u201cwhat your trade may be? \u201d \u201cCommissionaire, sir,\u201d he said, gruffly. \u201cUniform away for repairs. \u201d \u201cAnd you were? \u201d I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my companion. \u201cA sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir.

SHERLOCK HOLMES,-- \u201cThere has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of \u2018Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.\u2019 There had been no robbery, nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of blood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a loss as to how he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler. If you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you will find me there. I have left everything _in statu quo_ until I hear from you. If you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details, and would esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion. Yours faithfully, \u201cTOBIAS GREGSON. \u201d \u201cGregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,\u201d my friend remarked; \u201che and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and energetic, but conventional--shockingly so. They have their knives into one another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put upon the scent. \u201d I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. \u201cSurely there is not a moment to be lost,\u201d I cried, \u201cshall I go and order you a cab? \u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure about whether I shall go.

It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the house-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets beneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,\u201d I said at last, interrupting Holmes\u2019 musical disquisition. \u201cNo data yet,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment. \u201d \u201cYou will have your data soon,\u201d I remarked, pointing with my finger; \u201cthis is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much mistaken. \u201d \u201cSo it is. Stop, driver, stop! \u201d We were still a hundred yards or so from it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon foot. Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and there a \u201cTo Let\u201d card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within. I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me. At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced, flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my companion\u2019s hand with effusion. \u201cIt is indeed kind of you to come,\u201d he said, \u201cI have had everything left untouched. \u201d \u201cExcept that! \u201d my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. \u201cIf a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you permitted this. \u201d \u201cI have had so much to do inside the house,\u201d the detective said evasively. \u201cMy colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here.

A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires. It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath. Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment. All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London. Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and greeted my companion and myself. \u201cThis case will make a stir, sir,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIt beats anything I have seen, and I am no chicken. \u201d \u201cThere is no clue? \u201d said Gregson. \u201cNone at all,\u201d chimed in Lestrade. Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it intently. \u201cYou are sure that there is no wound? \u201d he asked, pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round. \u201cPositive! \u201d cried both detectives. \u201cThen, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual--[8] presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the year \u201834. Do you remember the case, Gregson? \u201d \u201cNo, sir. \u201d \u201cRead it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It has all been done before. \u201d As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man\u2019s lips, and then glanced a'), NULL);

At his call they entered the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s been a woman here,\u201d he cried. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s wedding-ring. \u201d He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered round him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride. \u201cThis complicates matters,\u201d said Gregson. \u201cHeaven knows, they were complicated enough before. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019re sure it doesn\u2019t simplify them? \u201d observed Holmes. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his pockets? \u201d \u201cWe have it all here,\u201d said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. \u201cA gold watch, No. 97163, by Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring, with masonic device. Gold pin--bull-dog\u2019s head, with rubies as eyes. Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition of Boccaccio\u2019s \u2018Decameron,\u2019 with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the fly-leaf. Two letters--one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph Stangerson. \u201d \u201cAt what address? \u201d \u201cAmerican Exchange, Strand--to be left till called for. They are both from the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their boats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to New York. \u201d \u201cHave you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson? \u201d \u201cI did it at once, sir,\u201d said Gregson. \u201cI have had advertisements sent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American Exchange, but he has not returned yet. \u201d \u201cHave you sent to Cleveland? \u201d \u201cWe telegraphed this morning. \u201d \u201cHow did you word your inquiries? \u201d \u201cWe simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us. \u201d \u201cYou did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial? \u201d \u201cI asked about Stangerson. \u201d \u201cNothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to hinge? Will you not telegraph again? \u201d \u201cI have said all I have to say,\u201d said Gregson, in an offended voice. Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene, rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner. \u201cMr. Gregson,\u201d he said, \u201cI have just made a discovery of the highest importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a careful examination of the walls. \u201d The little man\u2019s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague. \u201cCome here,\u201d he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. \u201cNow, stand there! \u201d He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall. \u201cLook at that! \u201d he said, triumphantly. I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was scrawled in blood-red letters a single word-- RACHE. \u201cWhat do you think of that? \u201d cried the detective, with the air of a showman exhibiting his show. \u201cThis was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where it has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow'), NULL);

It was lit at the time, and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall. \u201d \u201cAnd what does it mean now that you _have_ found it? \u201d asked Gregson in a depreciatory voice. \u201cMean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name Rachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark my words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named Rachel has something to do with it. It\u2019s all very well for you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but the old hound is the best, when all is said and done. \u201d \u201cI really beg your pardon! \u201d said my companion, who had ruffled the little man\u2019s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. \u201cYou certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out, and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last night\u2019s mystery. I have not had time to examine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now. \u201d As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once lying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes across the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his glass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket. \u201cThey say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,\u201d he remarked with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad definition, but it does apply to detective work. \u201d Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres [9] of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that Sherlock Holmes\u2019 smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end. \u201cWhat do you think of it, sir? \u201d they both asked. \u201cIt would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume to help you,\u201d remarked my friend. \u201cYou are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere. \u201d There was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke. \u201cIf you will let me know how your investigations go,\u201d he continued, \u201cI shall be happy to give you any help I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found the body. Can you give me his name and address? \u201d Lestrade glanced at his note-book. \u201cJohn Rance,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is off duty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate. \u201d Holmes took a note of the address. \u201cCome along, Doctor,\u201d he said; \u201cwe shall go and look him up. I\u2019ll tell you one thing which may help you in the case,\u201d he continued, turning to the two detectives. \u201cThere has been murder done, and the murderer was a man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. In all '), NULL);

Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade. \u201cThere is nothing like first hand evidence,\u201d he remarked; \u201cas a matter of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned. \u201d \u201cYou amaze me, Holmes,\u201d said I. \u201cSurely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no room for a mistake,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse\u2019s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morning--I have Gregson\u2019s word for that--it follows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house. \u201d \u201cThat seems simple enough,\u201d said I; \u201cbut how about the other man\u2019s height? \u201d \u201cWhy, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow\u2019s stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of checking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground. It was child\u2019s play. \u201d \u201cAnd his age? \u201d I asked. \u201cWell, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest effort, he can\u2019t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across. Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over. There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I advocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you? \u201d \u201cThe finger nails and the Trichinopoly,\u201d I suggested. \u201cThe writing on the wall was done with a man\u2019s forefinger dipped in blood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man\u2019s nail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor. It was dark in colour and flakey--such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes--in fact, I have written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type. \u201d \u201cAnd the florid face? \u201d I asked. \u201cAh, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was right. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair. \u201d I passed my hand over my brow. \u201cMy head is in a whirl,\u201d I remarked; \u201cthe more one thinks of it the more'), NULL);

How could one man compel another to take poison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman\u2019s ring there? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these facts. \u201d My companion smiled approvingly. \u201cYou sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up my mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade\u2019s discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel. I\u2019m not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all. \u201d \u201cI shall never do that,\u201d I answered; \u201cyou have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world. \u201d My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you one other thing,\u201d he said. \u201cPatent leathers [10] and Square-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible--arm-in-arm, in all probability. When they got inside they walked up and down the room--or rather, Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I could read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I\u2019ve told you all I know myself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go to Halle\u2019s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon. \u201d This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand. \u201cThat\u2019s Audley Court in there,\u201d he said, pointing to a narrow slit in the line of dead-coloured brick. \u201cYou\u2019ll find me here when you come back. \u201d Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming. He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his slumbers. \u201cI made my report at the office,\u201d he said. Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively. \u201cWe thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips,\u201d he said. \u201cI shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,\u201d the constable answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk. \u201cJust let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred. \u201d Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though determined not to omit anything in his narrative. \u201cI\u2019ll tell it ye from the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cMy time is from ten at night to six in the'), NULL);

At one o\u2019clock it began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher--him who has the Holland Grove beat--and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin\u2019. Presently--maybe about two or a little after--I thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down, though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin\u2019 down, thinkin\u2019 between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who won\u2019t have the drains seen to, though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o\u2019 typhoid fever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the window, and I suspected as something was wrong.

Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome, that I thought I\u2019d be none the worse for some one with me. I ain\u2019t afeared of anything on this side o\u2019 the grave; but I thought that maybe it was him that died o\u2019 the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o\u2019 turn, and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher\u2019s lantern, but there wasn\u2019t no sign of him nor of anyone else. \u201d \u201cThere was no one in the street? \u201d \u201cNot a livin\u2019 soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself together and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside, so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin\u2019. There was a candle flickerin\u2019 on the mantelpiece--a red wax one--and by its light I saw----\u201d \u201cYes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times, and you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried the kitchen door, and then----\u201d John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his eyes. \u201cWhere was you hid to see all that? \u201d he cried. \u201cIt seems to me that you knows a deal more than you should. \u201d Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable. \u201cDon\u2019t get arresting me for the murder,\u201d he said. \u201cI am one of the hounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for that. Go on, though. What did you do next? \u201d Rance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression. \u201cI went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That brought Murcher and two more to the spot. \u201d \u201cWas the street empty then? \u201d \u201cWell, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes. \u201d \u201cWhat do you mean? \u201d The constable\u2019s features broadened into a grin. \u201cI\u2019ve seen many a drunk chap in my time,\u201d he said, \u201cbut never anyone so cryin\u2019 drunk as that cove.

He couldn\u2019t stand, far less help. \u201d \u201cWhat sort of a man was he? \u201d asked Sherlock Holmes.

After Holmes\u2019 departure for the concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours\u2019 sleep. It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonment [11] in the eyes of the law. The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion\u2019s hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had caused the man\u2019s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. As long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet self-confident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained all the facts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture. He was very late in returning--so late, that I knew that the concert could not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table before he appeared. \u201cIt was magnificent,\u201d he said, as he took his seat. \u201cDo you remember what Darwi'), NULL);

He claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s rather a broad idea,\u201d I remarked. \u201cOne\u2019s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature,\u201d he answered. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You\u2019re not looking quite yourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you. \u201d \u201cTo tell the truth, it has,\u201d I said. \u201cI ought to be more case-hardened after my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at Maiwand without losing my nerve. \u201d \u201cI can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you seen the evening paper? \u201d \u201cNo. \u201d \u201cIt gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the fact that when the man was raised up, a woman\u2019s wedding ring fell upon the floor. It is just as well it does not. \u201d \u201cWhy? \u201d \u201cLook at this advertisement,\u201d he answered. \u201cI had one sent to every paper this morning immediately after the affair. \u201d He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. It was the first announcement in the \u201cFound\u201d column. \u201cIn Brixton Road, this morning,\u201d it ran, \u201ca plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway between the \u2018White Hart\u2019 Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson, 221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening. \u201d \u201cExcuse my using your name,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I used my own some of these dunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair. \u201d \u201cThat is all right,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut supposing anyone applies, I have no ring. \u201d \u201cOh yes, you have,\u201d said he, handing me one. \u201cThis will do very well. It is almost a facsimile. \u201d \u201cAnd who do you expect will answer this advertisement. \u201d \u201cWhy, the man in the brown coat--our florid friend with the square toes. If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice. \u201d \u201cWould he not consider it as too dangerous? \u201d \u201cNot at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason to believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber\u2019s body, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put yourself in that man\u2019s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving the house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. His eye, of course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder. He would come. He will come. You shall see him within an hour? \u201d \u201cAnd then? \u201d I asked. \u201cOh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms? \u201d \u201cI have my old service revolver and a few cartridges. \u201d \u201cYou had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for anything. \u201d I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin. \u201cThe plot thickens,\u201d he said, as I entered; \u201cI have just had an answer to my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one. \u201d \u201cAnd that is? \u201d I asked eagerly. \u201cMy fiddle would be the better for new strings,\u201d he remarked. \u201cPut your pistol in your pocket.

On the fly-leaf, in very faded ink, is written \u2018Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte. \u2019 I wonder who William Whyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His writing has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think. \u201d As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the servant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it. \u201cDoes Dr. Watson live here? \u201d asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We could not hear the servant\u2019s reply, but the door closed, and some one began to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feeble tap at the door. \u201cCome in,\u201d I cried. At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to keep my countenance. The old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our advertisement. \u201cIt\u2019s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,\u201d she said, dropping another curtsey; \u201ca gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It belongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth, which her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he\u2019d say if he come \u2018ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think, he being short enough at the best o\u2019 times, but more especially when he has the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night along with----\u201d \u201cIs that her ring? \u201d I asked. \u201cThe Lord be thanked! \u201d cried the old woman; \u201cSally will be a glad woman this night. That\u2019s the ring. \u201d \u201cAnd what may your address be? \u201d I inquired, taking up a pencil. \u201c13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here. \u201d \u201cThe Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes sharply. The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little red-rimmed eyes. \u201cThe gentleman asked me for _my_ address,\u201d she said. \u201cSally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham. \u201d \u201cAnd your name is----? \u201d \u201cMy name is Sawyer--her\u2019s is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her--and a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he\u2019s at sea, and no steward in the company more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what with liquor shops----\u201d \u201cHere is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,\u201d I interrupted, in obedience to a sign from my companion; \u201cit clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner. \u201d With many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs. Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat. \u201cI\u2019ll follow her,\u201d he said, hurriedly; \u201cshe must be an accomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me. \u201d The hall door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended the stair. Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly along the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind. \u201cEither his whole theory is incorrect,\u201d I thought to myself, \u201cor else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery. \u201d There was n'), NULL);

Eleven, and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same destination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of his latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not been successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a hearty laugh. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,\u201d he cried, dropping into his chair; \u201cI have chaffed them so much that they would never have let me hear the end of it.

That creature had gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being foot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address, but I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street, \u2018Drive to 13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch,\u2019 she cried. This begins to look genuine, I thought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind. That\u2019s an art which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away we rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in question. I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down the street in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver jumped down, and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing came out though. When I reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or trace of his passenger, and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare. On inquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there. \u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say,\u201d I cried, in amazement, \u201cthat that tottering, feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion, without either you or the driver seeing her? \u201d \u201cOld woman be damned! \u201d said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. \u201cWe were the old women to be so taken in.

The Socialists had many branches in America, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England. The _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening of all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the boarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell. He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of catching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon the platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber\u2019s body was, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road, many miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are questions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it is confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily throw light upon the matter. The _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these men there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was punished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary, Stangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had boarded--a result which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard. Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and they appeared to afford him considerable amusement. \u201cI told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure to score. \u201d \u201cThat depends on how it turns out. \u201d \u201cOh, bless you, it doesn\u2019t matter in the least.

They are as sharp as needles, too; all they want is organisation. \u201d \u201cIs it on this Brixton case that you are employing them? \u201d I asked. \u201cYes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain.

Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There he is! \u201d There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the fair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and burst into our sitting-room. \u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d he cried, wringing Holmes\u2019 unresponsive hand, \u201ccongratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day. \u201d A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion\u2019s expressive face. \u201cDo you mean that you are on the right track? \u201d he asked. \u201cThe right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key. \u201d \u201cAnd his name is? \u201d \u201cArthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty\u2019s navy,\u201d cried Gregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest. Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile. \u201cTake a seat, and try one of these cigars,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are anxious to know how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water? \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d the detective answered. \u201cThe tremendous exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brain-workers. \u201d \u201cYou do me too much honour,\u201d said Holmes, gravely. \u201cLet us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result. \u201d The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently at his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement. \u201cThe fun of it is,\u201d he cried, \u201cthat that fool Lestrade, who thinks himself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is after the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this time. \u201d The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked. \u201cAnd how did you get your clue? \u201d \u201cAh, I\u2019ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is strictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this American\u2019s antecedents. Some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or until parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not Tobias Gregson\u2019s way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the dead man? \u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cby John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road. \u201d Gregson looked quite crest-fallen. \u201cI had no idea that you noticed that,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you been there? \u201d \u201cNo. \u201d \u201cHa! \u201d cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; \u201cyou should never neglect a chance, however small it may seem. \u201d \u201cTo a great mind, nothing is little,\u201d remarked Holmes, sententiously. \u201cWell, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once. He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier\u2019s Boarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address. \u201d \u201cSmart--very smart! \u201d murmured Sherlock Holmes. \u201cI next called upon Madame Charpentier,\u201d continued the detective. \u201cI found her very pale and distressed.

Besides, you do not know how much we know of it. \u2019 \u201c\u2018On your head be it, Alice! \u2019 cried her mother; and then, turning to me, \u2018I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character, his profession, his antecedents would all forbid it. \u2019 \u201c\u2018Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,\u2019 I answered. \u2018Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse. \u2019 \u201c\u2018Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,\u2019 she said, and her daughter withdrew. \u2018Now, sir,\u2019 she continued, \u2018I had no intention of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all without omitting any particular. \u2019 \u201c\u2018It is your wisest course,\u2019 said I. \u201c\u2018Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his secretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed a \u201cCopenhagen\u201d label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise. He was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o\u2019clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar. Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her--an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct. \u2019 \u201c\u2018But why did you stand all this,\u2019 I asked. \u2018I suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish. \u2019 \u201cMrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. \u2018Would to God that I had given him notice on the very day that he came,\u2019 she said. \u2018But it was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each--fourteen pounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy in the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for the best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to leave on account of it. That was the reason of his going. \u2019 \u201c\u2018Well? \u2019 \u201c\u2018My heart grew light when I saw him drive away.

He was much excited, and evidently the worse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her that she should fly with him. \u201cYou are of age,\u201d he said, \u201cand there is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a princess. \u201d Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think that fine fellow will trouble us again,\u201d he said. \u201cI will just go after him and see what he does with himself. \u201d With those words he took his hat and started off down the street. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber\u2019s mysterious death. \u2019 \u201cThis statement came from Mrs. Charpentier\u2019s lips with many gasps and pauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there should be no possibility of a mistake. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s quite exciting,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. \u201cWhat happened next? \u201d \u201cWhen Mrs. Charpentier paused,\u201d the detective continued, \u201cI saw that the whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her son returned. \u201c\u2018I do not know,\u2019 she answered. \u201c\u2018Not know? \u2019 \u201c\u2018No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in. \u2019 \u201c\u2018After you went to bed? \u2019 \u201c\u2018Yes. \u2019 \u201c\u2018When did you go to bed? \u2019 \u201c\u2018About eleven. \u2019 \u201c\u2018So your son was gone at least two hours? \u2019 \u201c\u2018Yes. \u2019 \u201c\u2018Possibly four or five? \u2019 \u201c\u2018Yes. \u2019 \u201c\u2018What was he doing during that time? \u2019 \u201c\u2018I do not know,\u2019 she answered, turning white to her very lips. \u201cOf course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and arrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, \u2018I suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber,\u2019 he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect. \u201d \u201cVery,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHe still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel. \u201d \u201cWhat is your theory, then? \u201d \u201cWell, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night was so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent. \u201d \u201cWell done! \u201d said Holmes in an encouraging voice. \u201cReally, Gregson, you are getting along. We shall make something of you yet. \u201d \u201cI flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,\u201d the detective answered proudly. \u201cThe young man volunteered a statement, in which he said that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him, and took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an old shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this old shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply.

The assurance and jauntiness which generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting. His face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged and untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. \u201cThis is a most extraordinary case,\u201d he said at last--\u201ca most incomprehensible affair. \u201d \u201cAh, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade! \u201d cried Gregson, triumphantly. \u201cI thought you would come to that conclusion.

Gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes. \u201cStangerson too! \u201d he muttered. \u201cThe plot thickens. \u201d \u201cIt was quite thick enough before,\u201d grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair. \u201cI seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war. \u201d \u201cAre you--are you sure of this piece of intelligence? \u201d stammered Gregson. \u201cI have just come from his room,\u201d said Lestrade. \u201cI was the first to discover what had occurred. \u201d \u201cWe have been hearing Gregson\u2019s view of the matter,\u201d Holmes observed. \u201cWould you mind letting us know what you have seen and done? \u201d \u201cI have no objection,\u201d Lestrade answered, seating himself. \u201cI freely confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out what had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston Station about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in the morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next morning. \u201d \u201cThey would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cSo it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and at eight o\u2019clock I reached Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, in Little George Street. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there, they at once answered me in the affirmative. \u201c\u2018No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,\u2019 they said. \u2018He has been waiting for a gentleman for two days. \u2019 \u201c\u2018Where is he now? \u2019 I asked. \u201c\u2018He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine. \u2019 \u201c\u2018I will go up and see him at once,\u2019 I said. \u201cIt seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me the room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor leading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in spite of my twenty years\u2019 experience.

I gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it in. The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned him over, the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man? \u201d I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes answered. \u201cThe word RACHE, written in letters of blood,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was it,\u201d said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all silent for a while. There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as I thought of it. \u201cThe man was seen,\u201d continued Lestrade. \u201cA milk boy, passing on his way to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular notice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found blood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife. \u201d I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which tallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face. \u201cDid you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer? \u201d he asked. \u201cNothing. Stangerson had Drebber\u2019s purse in his pocket, but it seems that this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd pounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man\u2019s pocket, except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the words, \u2018J. H. is in Europe. \u2019 There was no name appended to this message. \u201d \u201cAnd there was nothing else? \u201d Holmes asked. \u201cNothing of any importance. The man\u2019s novel, with which he had read himself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair beside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills. \u201d Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight. \u201cThe last link,\u201d he cried, exultantly. \u201cMy case is complete. \u201d The two detectives stared at him in amazement. \u201cI have now in my hands,\u201d my companion said, confidently, \u201call the threads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the discovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own eyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand upon those pills? \u201d \u201cI have them,\u201d said Lestrade, producing a small white box; \u201cI took them and the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of safety at the Police Station.

They were of a pearly grey colour, small, round, and almost transparent against the light. \u201cFrom their lightness and transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,\u201d I remarked. \u201cPrecisely so,\u201d answered Holmes. \u201cNow would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday. \u201d I went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms. It\u2019s laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end. Indeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the rug. \u201cI will now cut one of these pills in two,\u201d said Holmes, and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word. \u201cOne half we return into the box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves. \u201d \u201cThis may be very interesting,\u201d said Lestrade, in the injured tone of one who suspects that he is being laughed at, \u201cI cannot see, however, what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. \u201d \u201cPatience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has everything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough. \u201d As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock Holmes\u2019 earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling effect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched upon tho [16] cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught. Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the table, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was his emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two detectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which he had met. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a coincidence,\u201d he cried, at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room; \u201cit is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the case of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And yet they are inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have it! \u201d With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The unfortunate creature\u2019s tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning. Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his forehead. \u201cI should have more faith,\u201d he said; \u201cI ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that before ever I saw the box at all. \u201d This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog, however, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually'), NULL);

I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _outr\u00e9_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making it less so. \u201d Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable impatience, could contain himself no longer. \u201cLook here, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something more than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking the man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade went after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too. You have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more than we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the man who did it? \u201d \u201cI cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,\u201d remarked Lestrade. \u201cWe have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer. \u201d \u201cAny delay in arresting the assassin,\u201d I observed, \u201cmight give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity. \u201d Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought. \u201cThere will be no more murders,\u201d he said at last, stopping abruptly and facing us. \u201cYou can put that consideration out of the question. You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by another who is as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but if he had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city. Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match for the official force, and that is why I have not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to this omission; but that I am prepared for. At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations, I shall do so. \u201d Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance, or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police.

I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes\u2019 triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman\u2019s dazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might have been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes\u2019s grasp, and hurled himself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but before he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and then commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he, that the four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until Lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless and panting. \u201cWe have his cab,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cIt will serve to take him to Scotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,\u201d he continued, with a pleasant smile, \u201cwe have reached the end of our little mystery.

Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged ca\u00f1ons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust.

The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness. In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of alkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull, grey earth--above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but silence--complete and heart-subduing silence. It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside. Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May, eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region. An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his clothes, which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man was dying--dying from hunger and from thirst. He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild questioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. \u201cWhy not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,\u201d he muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder. Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists. \u201cYou\u2019ve hurt me! \u201d said a childish voice reproach'), NULL);

The child was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion. \u201cHow is it now? \u201d he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head. \u201cKiss it and make it well,\u201d she said, with perfect gravity, shoving [19] the injured part up to him. \u201cThat\u2019s what mother used to do.

It ain\u2019t easy to talk when your lips is like leather, but I guess I\u2019d best let you know how the cards lie. What\u2019s that you\u2019ve got? \u201d \u201cPretty things! fine things! \u201d cried the little girl enthusiastically, holding up two glittering fragments of mica. \u201cWhen we goes back to home I\u2019ll give them to brother Bob. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll see prettier things than them soon,\u201d said the man confidently. \u201cYou just wait a bit.

Then I thought there was some chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together. It don\u2019t seem as though we\u2019ve improved matters. There\u2019s an almighty small chance for us now! \u201d \u201cDo you mean that we are going to die too? \u201d asked the child, checking her sobs, and raising her tear-stained face. \u201cI guess that\u2019s about the size of it. \u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so before? \u201d she said, laughing gleefully. \u201cYou gave me such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we\u2019ll be with mother again. \u201d \u201cYes, you will, dearie. \u201d \u201cAnd you too. I\u2019ll tell her how awful good you\u2019ve been.

In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, the vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death. \u201cCocks and hens,\u201d cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their ill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. \u201cSay, did God make this country? \u201d \u201cIn course He did,\u201d said her companion, rather startled by this unexpected question. \u201cHe made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,\u201d the little girl continued. \u201cI guess somebody else made the country in these parts.

Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face, and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were face to face, while the two voices--the one thin and clear, the other deep and harsh--united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the man\u2019s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber. Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West. But what a caravan! When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them. At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among themselves. \u201cThe wells are to the right, my brothers,\u201d said one, a hard-lipped, clean-shaven man with grizzly hair. \u201cTo the right of the Sierra Blanco--so we shall reach the Rio Grande,\u201d said another. \u201cFear not for water,\u201d cried a third. \u201cHe who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon His own chosen people. \u201d \u201cAmen!

From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink, showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word \u2018Redskins\u2019 was on every lip. \u201cThere can\u2019t be any number of Injuns here,\u201d said the elderly man who appeared to be in command. \u201cWe have passed the Pawnees, and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains. \u201d \u201cShall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,\u201d asked one of the band. \u201cAnd I,\u201d \u201cand I,\u201d cried a dozen voices. \u201cLeave your horses below and we will await you here,\u201d the Elder answered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their horses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts. The watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who had first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their eyes. On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man, long-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep. Beside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her infantile features. Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away. The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about [20] them in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. His face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his boney hand over his eyes. \u201cThis is what they call delirium, I guess,\u201d he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the skirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood. The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that their appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little girl, and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her gaunt companion, and assisted him towards the waggons. \u201cMy name is John Ferrier,\u201d the wanderer explained; \u201cme and that little un are all that\u2019s left o\u2019 twenty-one people.

Many were the cries of astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the other. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of its appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were furnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He was reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid it aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then he turned to the two castaways. \u201cIf we take you with us,\u201d he said, in solemn words, \u201cit can only be as believers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms? \u201d \u201cGuess I\u2019ll come with you on any terms,\u201d said Ferrier, with such emphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader alone retained his stern, impressive expression. \u201cTake him, Brother Stangerson,\u201d he said, \u201cgive him food and drink, and the child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion! \u201d \u201cOn, on to Zion! \u201d cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled down the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was already awaiting them. \u201cYou shall remain here,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues.

The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and disease--every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore.

All around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger. From the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers. The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson\u2019s waggon, a retreat which she shared with the Mormon\u2019s three wives and with his son, a headstrong forward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood, from the shock caused by her mother\u2019s death, she soon became a pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders. On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial log-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his neighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier. There was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and straight-walking man. Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted father in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger, her cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier\u2019s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father\u2019s mustang, and managing it with'), NULL);

So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope. It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns, with a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. In the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides. It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden. She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts. \u201cYou\u2019re not hurt, I hope, miss,\u201d said her preserver, respectfully.

You ain\u2019t even a friend of ours. \u201d The young hunter\u2019s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy Ferrier laughed aloud. \u201cThere, I didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d she said; \u201cof course, you are a friend now. You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won\u2019t trust me with his business any more. Good-bye! \u201d \u201cGood-bye,\u201d he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over her little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her riding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust. Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn. He and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver, and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from his sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one. The love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper. He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance could render him successful. He called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his face was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the valley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this Jefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested Lucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a silver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to be had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms, but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her affections. It was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway. \u201cI am off, Lucy,\u201d he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing tenderly down into her face; \u201cI won\u2019t ask you to come wit'), NULL);

John Ferrier\u2019s heart was sore within him when he thought of the young man\u2019s return, and of the impending loss of his adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the Land of the Saints. Yes, a dangerous matter--so dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a swift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most terrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German Vehm-gericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the State of Utah. Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out against the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or what had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home, but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men went about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them. At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the recalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards to pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The supply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange rumours began to be bandied about--rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women appeared in the harems of the Elders--women who pined and wept, and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror.

These tales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and re-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name. To this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite Band, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one. Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless society. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret. The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the Prophet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every man feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were nearest his heart. One fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields, when he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window, saw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His heart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham Young himself. Full of trepidation--for he knew that such a visit boded him little good--Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. The latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with a stern face into the sitting-room. \u201cBrother Ferrier,\u201d he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly from under his light-coloured eyelashes, \u201cthe true believers have been good friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our protection. Is not this so? \u201d \u201cIt is so,\u201d answered John Ferrier. \u201cIn return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you should embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages. This you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have neglected. \u201d \u201cAnd how have I neglected it? \u201d asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in expostulation. \u201cHave I not given to the common fund? Have I not attended at the Temple? Have I not----? \u201d \u201cWhere are your wives? \u201d asked Young, looking round him. \u201cCall them in, that I may greet them. \u201d \u201cIt is true that I have not married,\u201d Ferrier answered. \u201cBut women were few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a lonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants. \u201d \u201cIt is of that daughter that I would speak to you,\u201d said the leader of the Mormons. \u201cShe has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land. \u201d John Ferrier groaned internally. \u201cThere are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve--stories that she is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues. What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith? \u2018Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if she wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin. \u2019 This being so, it is impossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your daughter to violate it. \u201d John Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his riding-whip. \u201cUpon this one point your whole faith shall be tested--so it has been decided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would not have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all choice. We Elders have many heifers, [29] but our children must also be provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose between them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say you to that? \u201d Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted. \u201cYou will give us time,\u201d he said at last. \u201cMy daughter is very young--she is scarce of an age to marry. \u201d \u201cShe shall have a month to choose,\u201d said Young, '), NULL);

He was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon his, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her pale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed. \u201cI could not help it,\u201d she said, in answer to his look. \u201cHis voice rang through the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do? \u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you scare yourself,\u201d he answered, drawing her to him, and passing his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair. \u201cWe\u2019ll fix it up somehow or another. You don\u2019t find your fancy kind o\u2019 lessening for this chap, do you? \u201d A sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer. \u201cNo; of course not. I shouldn\u2019t care to hear you say you did. He\u2019s a likely lad, and he\u2019s a Christian, which is more than these folk here, in spite o\u2019 all their praying and preaching. There\u2019s a party starting for Nevada to-morrow, and I\u2019ll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in. If I know anything o\u2019 that young man, he\u2019ll be back here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs. \u201d Lucy laughed through her tears at her father\u2019s description. \u201cWhen he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that I am frightened, dear. One hears--one hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to them. \u201d \u201cBut we haven\u2019t opposed him yet,\u201d her father answered. \u201cIt will be time to look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at the end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah. \u201d \u201cLeave Utah! \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s about the size of it. \u201d \u201cBut the farm? \u201d \u201cWe will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell the truth, Lucy, it isn\u2019t the first time I have thought of doing it. I don\u2019t care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their darned prophet. I\u2019m a free-born American, and it\u2019s all new to me. Guess I\u2019m too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction. \u201d \u201cBut they won\u2019t let us leave,\u201d his daughter objected. \u201cWait till Jefferson comes, and we\u2019ll soon manage that. In the meantime, don\u2019t you fret yourself, my dearie, and don\u2019t get your eyes swelled up, else he\u2019ll be walking into me when he sees you. There\u2019s nothing to be afeared about, and there\u2019s no danger at all. \u201d John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone, but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.</Body>\n        </Block>\n    </Chapter>\n    <Chapter id=\"10\" title=\"CHAPTER IV A FLIGHT FOR LIFE.\">\n        <Block>\n            <Body>ON the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet, John Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his acquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him with his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he should return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returned home with a lighter heart. As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate.

Both of them nodded to Ferrier as he entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know us,\u201d he said. \u201cThis here is the son of Elder Drebber, and I\u2019m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold. \u201d \u201cAs He will all the nations in His own good time,\u201d said the other in a nasal voice; \u201cHe grindeth slowly but exceeding small. \u201d John Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were. \u201cWe have come,\u201d continued Stangerson, \u201cat the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one. \u201d \u201cNay, nay, Brother Stangerson,\u201d cried the other; \u201cthe question is not how many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now given over his mills to me, and I am the richer man. \u201d \u201cBut my prospects are better,\u201d said the other, warmly. \u201cWhen the Lord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church. \u201d \u201cIt will be for the maiden to decide,\u201d rejoined young Drebber, smirking at his own reflection in the glass. \u201cWe will leave it all to her decision. \u201d During this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway, hardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors. \u201cLook here,\u201d he said at last, striding up to them, \u201cwhen my daughter summons you, you can come, but until then I don\u2019t want to see your faces again. \u201d The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this competition between them for the maiden\u2019s hand was the highest of honours both to her and her father. \u201cThere are two ways out of the room,\u201d cried Ferrier; \u201cthere is the door, and there is the window. Which do you care to use? \u201d His brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening, that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The old farmer followed them to the door. \u201cLet me know when you have settled which it is to be,\u201d he said, sardonically. \u201cYou shall smart for this! \u201d Stangerson cried, white with rage. \u201cYou have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the end of your days. \u201d \u201cThe hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,\u201d cried young Drebber; \u201cHe will arise and smite you! \u201d \u201cThen I\u2019ll start the smiting,\u201d exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would have rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and restrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses\u2019 hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach. \u201cThe young canting rascals! \u201d he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from his forehead; \u201cI would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the wife of either of them. \u201d \u201cAnd so should I, father,\u201d she answered, with spirit; \u201cbut Jefferson will soon be here. \u201d \u201cYes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we do not know what their next move may be. \u201d It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If minor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this arch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at'), NULL);

He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an unlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:-- \u201cTwenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then----\u201d The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his servants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been secured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but the incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck him to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him. Still more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not enlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door. Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls, sometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada. Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news of the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there came no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a driver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to four and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of escape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The more-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could pass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him. Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter\u2019s dishonour. He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague and terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter--what was to become of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence. What was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound--low, but very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of the house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was repeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had '), NULL);

Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open. Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were twinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the farmer\u2019s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier looked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl. So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope. \u201cGood God! \u201d gasped John Ferrier. \u201cHow you scared me! Whatever made you come in like that. \u201d \u201cGive me food,\u201d the other said, hoarsely. \u201cI have had no time for bite or sup for eight-and-forty hours. \u201d He flung himself upon the [21] cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host\u2019s supper, and devoured it voraciously. \u201cDoes Lucy bear up well? \u201d he asked, when he had satisfied his hunger. \u201cYes. She does not know the danger,\u201d her father answered. \u201cThat is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I crawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they\u2019re not quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter. \u201d John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a devoted ally. He seized the young man\u2019s leathery hand and wrung it cordially. \u201cYou\u2019re a man to be proud of,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve hit it there, pard,\u201d the young hunter answered. \u201cI have a respect for you, but if you were alone in this business I\u2019d think twice before I put my head into such a hornet\u2019s nest. It\u2019s Lucy that brings me here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o\u2019 the Hope family in Utah. \u201d \u201cWhat are we to do? \u201d \u201cTo-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost. I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much money have you? \u201d \u201cTwo thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes. \u201d \u201cThat will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for Carson City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house. \u201d While Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching journey, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into a small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by experience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the lovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was much to be done. \u201cWe must make our start at once,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril, but has steeled his heart to meet it. \u201cThe front and back entrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields. Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be half-way through the mountains. \u201d \u201cWhat if we are stopped,\u201d asked Ferrier.

All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head. Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and carefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow, where they lay silent and trembling. It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity. \u201cTo-morrow at midnight,\u201d said the first who appeared to be in authority. \u201cWhen the Whip-poor-Will calls three times. \u201d \u201cIt is well,\u201d returned the other. \u201cShall I tell Brother Drebber? \u201d \u201cPass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven! \u201d \u201cSeven to five! \u201d repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away in different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top of his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her. \u201cHurry on! hurry on! \u201d he gasped from time to time. \u201cWe are through the line of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on! \u201d Once on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid recognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led between them was the Eagle Ca\u00f1on in which the horses were awaiting them. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he came to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon one of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path. It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face Nature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster. On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all.

They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the jurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and pointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them as soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of \u201cWho goes there? \u201d rang through the silent ravine. \u201cTravellers for Nevada,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the rifle which hung by his saddle. They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply. \u201cBy whose permission? \u201d he asked. \u201cThe Holy Four,\u201d answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer. \u201cNine from seven,\u201d cried the sentinel. \u201cSeven from five,\u201d returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the countersign which he had heard in the garden. \u201cPass, and the Lord go with you,\u201d said the voice from above. Beyond his post the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a trot.

More than once they lost their way, but Hope\u2019s intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other\u2019s shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a gallop. As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. \u201cThey will be upon our track by this time,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives. \u201d During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag, where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there huddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours\u2019 sleep. Before daybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them. About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out.

Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals stood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view. He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity. At last, after two or three hours\u2019 fruitless search, he was thinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn--for so it is called--was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath. The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy over his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was already drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realized the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey. He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation. When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead silence still reigned all round. With his '), NULL);

There was no living creature near the remains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence--a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no traces behind it. Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of his companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point: JOHN FERRIER, FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, [22] Died August 4th, 1860. The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder\u2019s son. As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his last silent resting-place. Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least devote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels. For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Ca\u00f1on, from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he could look down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of festivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse\u2019s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towards him. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. He therefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier\u2019s fate had been. \u201cI am Jefferson Hope,\u201d he said. \u201cYou remembe'), NULL);

Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity, the man\u2019s surprise changed to consternation. \u201cYou are mad to come here,\u201d he cried. \u201cIt is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t fear them, or their warrant,\u201d Hope said, earnestly. \u201cYou must know something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t refuse to answer me. \u201d \u201cWhat is it? \u201d the Mormon asked uneasily. \u201cBe quick. The very rocks have ears and the trees eyes. \u201d \u201cWhat has become of Lucy Ferrier? \u201d \u201cShe was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you have no life left in you. \u201d \u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. \u201cMarried, you say? \u201d \u201cMarried yesterday--that\u2019s what those flags are for on the Endowment House. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which was to have her. They\u2019d both been in the party that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber\u2019s party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one won\u2019t have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then? \u201d \u201cYes, I am off,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light. \u201cWhere are you going? \u201d \u201cNever mind,\u201d he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder, strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself. The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish husband, who had married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier\u2019s property, did not affect any great grief at his bereavement; but his other wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the night before the burial, as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room. Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her finger. \u201cShe shall not be buried in that,\u201d he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared. For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson\u2019s window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boul'), NULL);

The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness. Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter\u2019s mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his enemy\u2019s game, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation. His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier\u2019s grave. Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at all, however, as to their whereabouts. Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that Drebber\u2019s house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe.

At last, having collected enough to keep life in him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris; and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than quote the old hunter\u2019s own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson\u2019s Journal, to which we are already under such obligations.</Body>\n        </Block>\n    </Chapter>\n    <Chapter id=\"12\" title=\"CHAPTER VI A CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D.\">\n        <Block>\n            <Body>OUR prisoner\u2019s furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself powerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. \u201cI guess you\u2019re going to take me to the police-station,\u201d he remarked to Sherlock Holmes. \u201cMy cab\u2019s at the door.

I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength. \u201cIf there\u2019s a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are the man for it,\u201d he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellow-lodger. \u201cThe way you kept on my trail was a caution. \u201d \u201cYou had better come with me,\u201d said Holmes to the two detectives. \u201cI can drive you,\u201d said Lestrade. \u201cGood! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us. \u201d I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner\u2019s name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged. The official was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way. \u201cThe prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week,\u201d he said; \u201cin the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say?

I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work.

She was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over it. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire. \u201cThey were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner\u2019s office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well. \u201cIt was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again. \u201cThey were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my cab'), NULL);

It was only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted. \u201cThey were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone. \u201cAt last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to their door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made his way out of the station. \u201cThe moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to solve. \u201cHe walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he had boarded.

My mouth gets dry with the talking. \u201d I handed him the glass, and he drank it down. \u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road. \u2018You hound,\u2019 he cried, shaking his stick at him; \u2018I\u2019ll teach you to insult an honest girl! \u2019 He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. \u2018Drive me to Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel,\u2019 said he. \u201cWhen I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove along slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might take him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when he solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving word that I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time, and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own hands. \u201cDon\u2019t imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only have been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself to do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I have filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor was lecturing on poisions, [25] and he showed his students some alkaloid, as he called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them. \u201cIt was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard and raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within--so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty long years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would understand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my nerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with excitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I see you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road. \u201cThere was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the dripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, \u2018It\u2019s time to get out,\u2019 I said. \u201c\u2018All right, cabby,\u2019 said he. \u201cI suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had men'), NULL);

I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little top-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the daughter were walking in front of us. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s infernally dark,\u2019 said he, stamping about. \u201c\u2018We\u2019ll soon have a light,\u2019 I said, striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which I had brought with me. \u2018Now, Enoch Drebber,\u2019 I continued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, \u2018who am I? \u2019 \u201cHe gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which showed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered in his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me. \u201c\u2018You dog! \u2019 I said; \u2018I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St. Petersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your wanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see to-morrow\u2019s sun rise. \u2019 He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I could see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time. The pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me. \u201c\u2018What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now? \u2019 I cried, locking the door, and shaking the key in his face. \u2018Punishment has been slow in coming, but it has overtaken you at last. \u2019 I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was useless. \u201c\u2018Would you murder me? \u2019 he stammered. \u201c\u2018There is no murder,\u2019 I answered. \u2018Who talks of murdering a mad dog? What mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her slaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem. \u2019 \u201c\u2018It was not I who killed her father,\u2019 he cried. \u201c\u2018But it was you who broke her innocent heart,\u2019 I shrieked, thrusting the box before him. \u2018Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you leave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled by chance. \u2019 \u201cHe cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as I saw it, and held Lucy\u2019s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of pain contorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him, staggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I turned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There was no movement. He was dead! \u201cThe blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of it. I don\u2019t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild. I had driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy\u2019s ring, and found '), NULL);

Thinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber\u2019s body, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly up to the house--for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of a police-officer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk. \u201cThat was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was to do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier\u2019s debt. I knew that he was staying at Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, and I hung about all day, but he never came out. [26] fancy that he suspected something when Drebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was Stangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which was the window of his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long before. I described Drebber\u2019s death to him, and I gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would have been the same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison. \u201cI have little more to say, and it\u2019s as well, for I am about done up. I went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I could save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next thing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly snackled [27] as ever I saw in my life. That\u2019s the whole of my story, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are. \u201d So thrilling had the man\u2019s narrative been, and his manner was so impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional detectives, _blas\u00e9_ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to be keenly interested in the man\u2019s story. When he finished we sat for some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of Lestrade\u2019s pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand account. \u201cThere is only one point on which I should like a little more information,\u201d Sherlock Holmes said at last. \u201cWho was your accomplice who came for the ring which I advertised? \u201d The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. \u201cI can tell my own secrets,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t get other people into trouble.

On the very night after his capture the aneurism burst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well done. \u201cGregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,\u201d Holmes remarked, as we chatted it over next evening. \u201cWhere will their grand advertisement be now? \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see that they had very much to do with his capture,\u201d I answered. \u201cWhat you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,\u201d returned my companion, bitterly. \u201cThe question is, what can you make people believe that you have done. Never mind,\u201d he continued, more brightly, after a pause. \u201cI would not have missed the investigation for anything. There has been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there were several most instructive points about it. \u201d \u201cSimple! \u201d I ejaculated. \u201cWell, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, smiling at my surprise. \u201cThe proof of its intrinsic simplicity is, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days. \u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said I. \u201cI have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically. \u201d \u201cI confess,\u201d said I, \u201cthat I do not quite follow you. \u201d \u201cI hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer. Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the result would be. They can put those events together in their minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards, or analytically. \u201d \u201cI understand,\u201d said I. \u201cNow this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all impressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman\u2019s brougham. \u201cThis was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden path, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable for taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the others, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the length of his stride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots. \u201c'), NULL);
INSERT INTO SYSTEM_LOB_STREAM VALUES(1, 53, STRINGDECODE('On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man\u2019s person, but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features. Having sniffed the dead man\u2019s lips I detected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist. \u201cAnd now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics, then, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder had, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there all the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political one, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber\u2019s former career. He answered, you remember, in the negative. \u201cI then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer\u2019s height, and furnished me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer\u2019s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly. \u201cHaving left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The answer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson Hope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to secure the murderer. \u201cI had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven the cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third person, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis.'), NULL);

On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time at least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore organized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in any case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into possession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised.

The details of the case will probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the victims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and Hope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the case has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well-known Scotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson. The man was apprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in the detective line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their services. \u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you so when we started? \u201d cried Sherlock Holmes with a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a testimonial! \u201d \u201cNever mind,\u201d I answered, \u201cI have all the facts in my journal, and the public shall know them.

So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings. Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"1#2\" wordCount=\"273\" sentimentScore=\"-0.3276\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.004456204379562044\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.007700729927007299\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.009288321167883211\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.007733576642335767\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0127992700729927\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.01202919708029197\"/>\n            <Body>On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspecte'), NULL);

As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments. The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself.

He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question, confirmed Stamford\u2019s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so. His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System.

Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him.

When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience.

On another occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform.

Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and there a \u201cTo Let\u201d card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within. I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"2#6\" wordCount=\"265\" sentimentScore=\"-0.35333333333333333\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" sco'), NULL);

Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me. At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced, flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my companion\u2019s hand with effusion. \u201cIt is indeed kind of you to come,\u201d he said, \u201cI have had everything left untouched. \u201d \u201cExcept that! \u201d my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. \u201cIf a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you permitted this. \u201d \u201cI have had so much to do inside the house,\u201d the detective said evasively. \u201cMy colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him to look after this. \u201d Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. \u201cWith two such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be much for a third party to find out,\u201d he said.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"2#7\" wordCount=\"267\" sentimentScore=\"-0.056210526315789475\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.0064777777777777785\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.012562962962962963\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.008400000000000001\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.01007777777777778\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.012066666666666667\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.007907407407407406\"/>\n            <Body>Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. \u201cI think we have done all that can be done,\u201d he answered; \u201cit\u2019s a queer case though, and I knew your taste for such things. \u201d \u201cYou did not come here in a cab? \u201d asked Sherlock Holmes. \u201cNo, sir. \u201d \u201cNor Lestrade? \u201d \u201cNo, sir. \u201d \u201cThen let us go and look at the room. \u201d With which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed his astonishment. A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires. It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath. Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"2#8\" wordCount=\"253\" sentimentScore=\"-0.506\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.021896153846153843\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"'), NULL);

At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London. Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and greeted my companion and myself. \u201cThis case will make a stir, sir,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIt beats anything I have seen, and I am no chicken. \u201d</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"2#9\" wordCount=\"262\" sentimentScore=\"-0.20153846153846156\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.01189513108614232\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.009157303370786516\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.009666666666666667\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.026378277153558054\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.022898876404494374\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.009973782771535579\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.013029962546816482\"/>\n            <Body>\u201cThere is no clue? \u201d said Gregson. \u201cNone at all,\u201d chimed in Lestrade. Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it intently. \u201cYou are sure that there is no wound? \u201d he asked, pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round. \u201cPositive! \u201d cried both detectives. \u201cThen, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual--[8] presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the year \u201834. Do you remember the case, Gregson? \u201d \u201cNo, sir. \u201d \u201cRead it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It has all been done before. \u201d As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man\u2019s lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots. \u201cHe has not been moved at all? \u201d he asked. \u201cNo more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination. \u201d \u201cYou can take him to the mortuary now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing more to be learned. \u201d Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"2#10\" wordCount=\"256\" sentimentScore=\"-0.08192\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"an'), NULL);

Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring, with masonic device. Gold pin--bull-dog\u2019s head, with rubies as eyes. Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J.

I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was scrawled in blood-red letters a single word-- RACHE. \u201cWhat do you think of that? \u201d cried the detective, with the air of a showman exhibiting his show. \u201cThis was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where it has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See that candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall. \u201d \u201cAnd what does it mean now that you _have_ found it? \u201d asked Gregson in a depreciatory voice. \u201cMean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name Rachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish.

With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once lying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes across the lost scent.

I\u2019ll tell you one thing which may help you in the case,\u201d he continued, turning to the two detectives. \u201cThere has been murder done, and the murderer was a man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only a few indications, but they may assist you. \u201d Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile. \u201cIf this man was murdered, how was it done? \u201d asked the former. \u201cPoison,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. \u201cOne other thing, Lestrade,\u201d he added, turning round at the door: \u201c\u2018Rache,\u2019 is the German for \u2018revenge;\u2019 so don\u2019t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel. \u201d With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals open-mouthed behind him.</Body>\n        </Block>\n    </Chapter>\n    <Chapter id=\"3\" title=\"CHAPTER IV WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL.\">\n        <Metadata wordCount=\"2578\">\n            <Locations>\n                <Location name=\"Holland Grove\" type=\"LOCATION\"/>\n                <Location name=\"Brixton Road\" type=\"LOCATION\"/>\n                <Location name=\"Henrietta Street\" type=\"LOCATION\"/>\n                <Location name=\"Lauriston Gardens\" type=\"LOCATION\"/>\n            </Locations>\n            <Characters>\n                <Character name=\"Lestrade\"/>\n                <Character name=\"Columbine\"/>\n                <Character name=\"John Rance\"/>\n                <Character name=\"Chopin\"/>\n                <Character name=\"Rance\"/>\n                <Character name=\"Harry Murcher\"/>\n                <Character name=\"Gregson\"/>\n                <C'), NULL);

Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade. \u201cThere is nothing like first hand evidence,\u201d he remarked; \u201cas a matter of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned. \u201d \u201cYou amaze me, Holmes,\u201d said I. \u201cSurely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no room for a mistake,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse\u2019s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morning--I have Gregson\u2019s word for that--it follows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house. \u201d \u201cThat seems simple enough,\u201d said I; \u201cbut how about the other man\u2019s height? \u201d</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"3#2\" wordCount=\"251\" sentimentScore=\"-0.15852631578947368\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.006709803921568627\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Body>\u201cWhy, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow\u2019s stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of checking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground. It was child\u2019s play. \u201d \u201cAnd his age? \u201d I asked. \u201cWell, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest effort, he can\u2019t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across. Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over. There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I advocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you? \u201d \u201cThe finger nails and the Trichinopoly,\u201d I suggested. \u201cThe writing on the wall was done with a man\u2019s forefinger dipped in blood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man\u2019s nail had been trimmed.

You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair. \u201d I passed my hand over my brow. \u201cMy head is in a whirl,\u201d I remarked; \u201cthe more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two men--if there were two men--into an empty house? What has become of the cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman\u2019s ring there? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping?

It was not done by a German. The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel. I\u2019m not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all. \u201d \u201cI shall never do that,\u201d I answered; \u201cyou have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world. \u201d My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in which I uttered them.

I\u2019ve told you all I know myself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go to Halle\u2019s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon. \u201d This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand. \u201cThat\u2019s Audley Court in there,\u201d he said, pointing to a narrow slit in the line of dead-coloured brick. \u201cYou\u2019ll find me here when you come back. \u201d Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming. He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his slumbers.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"3#6\" wordCount=\"287\" sentimentScore=\"-0.3826666666666666\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.005107744107744107\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.008131313131313132\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.003447811447811448\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.004616161616161616\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.011501683501683502\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.003444444444444444\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.010622895622895624\"/>\n            <Body>\u201cI made my report at the office,\u201d he said.

At eleven there was a fight at the \u2018White Hart\u2019; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o\u2019clock it began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher--him who has the Holland Grove beat--and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin\u2019. Presently--maybe about two or a little after--I thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down, though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin\u2019 down, thinkin\u2019 between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who won\u2019t have the drains seen to, though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o\u2019 typhoid fever.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"3#7\" wordCount=\"286\" sentimentScore=\"-0.4902857142857142\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.004224489795918367\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.003721088435374149\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.011795918367346938\"/>\n   '), NULL);

Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome, that I thought I\u2019d be none the worse for some one with me. I ain\u2019t afeared of anything on this side o\u2019 the grave; but I thought that maybe it was him that died o\u2019 the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o\u2019 turn, and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher\u2019s lantern, but there wasn\u2019t no sign of him nor of anyone else. \u201d \u201cThere was no one in the street? \u201d \u201cNot a livin\u2019 soul, sir, nor as much as a dog.

There was a candle flickerin\u2019 on the mantelpiece--a red wax one--and by its light I saw----\u201d \u201cYes, I know all that you saw.

After Holmes\u2019 departure for the concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours\u2019 sleep. It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonment [11] in the eyes of the law. The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion\u2019s hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had caused the man\u2019s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"4#2\" wordCount=\"253\" sentimentScore=\"-0.1518\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.007253846153846153\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.012976923076923077\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.004026923076923077\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.0068615384615384615\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.011034615384615384\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.007211538461538462\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.02134230769230769\"/>\n            <Body>As long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself.

This begins to look genuine, I thought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind. That\u2019s an art which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away we rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in question. I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down the street in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver jumped down, and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing came out though. When I reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or trace of his passenger, and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"4#10\" wordCount=\"227\" sentimentScore=\"-0.3492307692307693\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.013078260869565218\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.009673913043478262\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.01676521739130435\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.009747826086956521\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.01641304347826087\"/>\n            <Body>On inquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there. \u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say,\u201d I cried, in amazement, \u201cthat that tottering, feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion, without either you or the driver seeing her? \u201d \u201cOld woman be damned! \u201d said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. \u201cWe were the old women to be so taken in.

Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it in addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I still retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing upon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:-- The _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German name of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister inscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in America, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England. The _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening of all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the boarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell. He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"5#2\" wordCount=\"257\" sentimentScore=\"-0.3738181818181818\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.012795366795366794\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.014830115830115832\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.009382239382239383\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.0148996138996139\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.01961776061776062\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.004644787644787644\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.009'), NULL);

How he came there, or how he met his fate, are questions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it is confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily throw light upon the matter. The _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these men there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was punished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary, Stangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had boarded--a result which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"5#3\" wordCount=\"253\" sentimentScore=\"-0.10652631578947368\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.006466666666666667\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.008054901960784315\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.008580392156862744\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.007231372549019608\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.012070588235294118\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.014733333333333333\"/>\n            <Body>Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and they appeared to afford him considerable amusement. \u201cI told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure to score. \u201d \u201cThat depends on how it turns out. \u201d \u201cOh, bless you, it doesn\u2019t matter in the least.

He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular notice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found blood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife. \u201d I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which tallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face. \u201cDid you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer? \u201d he asked. \u201cNothing. Stangerson had Drebber\u2019s purse in his pocket, but it seems that this was usual, as he did all the paying.

From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged ca\u00f1ons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery. There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other hunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their prairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness. In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye c'), NULL);

In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull, grey earth--above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but silence--complete and heart-subduing silence. It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside. Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May, eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region. An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"7#3\" wordCount=\"281\" sentimentScore=\"-0.6744\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.012003521126760563\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.012320422535211269\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.005883802816901409\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.023464788732394368\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.02313028169014084\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0055281690140845064\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.02073943661971831\"/>\n            <Body>His face was lean and haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his clothes, which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man was dying--dying from hunger and from thirst. He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild questioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. \u201cWhy not here, as well as in a feather bed, tw'), NULL);

He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the man\u2019s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber. Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"7#9\" wordCount=\"266\" sentimentScore=\"-0.43811764705882356\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.010417582417582415\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.010531135531135532\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.007871794871794872\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.014084249084249083\"/>\n            <Body>But what a caravan! When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them. At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among themselves. \u201cThe wells are to the right, my brothers,\u201d said one, a hard-lipped, clean-shaven man with grizzly hair. \u201cTo the right of the Sierra Blanco--so we shall reach the Rio Grande,\u201d said another. \u201cFear not for water,\u201d cried a third. \u201cHe who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon His own chosen people. \u201d \u201cAmen!

Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were furnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece.

Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson\u2019s waggon, a retreat which she shared with the Mormon\u2019s three wives and with his son, a headstrong forward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood, from the shock caused by her mother\u2019s death, she soon became a pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders.

In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"8#6\" wordCount=\"261\" sentimentScore=\"-0.1044\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.021034220532319393\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.019847908745247146\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.010365019011406844\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.035262357414448664\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.02204942965779468\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.020942965779467682\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.017737642585551328\"/>\n            <Body>Scarcely had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"8#7\" wordCount=\"250\" sentimentScore=\"-0.10526315789473684\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.014759689922480619\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.020449612403100777\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.007085271317829458\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.024472868217054265\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.015810077519379847\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.009325581395348836\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.027647286821705426\"/>\n            <Body>\u201cYou\u2019re not hurt, I hope, miss,\u201d said her preserver, respectfully.

He and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver, and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from his sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one.

John Ferrier\u2019s heart was sore within him when he thought of the young man\u2019s return, and of the impending loss of his adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the Land of the Saints. Yes, a dangerous matter--so dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a swift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most terrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German Vehm-gericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the State of Utah. Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this organization doubly terrible.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"9#2\" wordCount=\"266\" sentimentScore=\"-0.8866666666666667\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.018401486988847585\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.006650557620817845\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.014107806691449816\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.028914498141263942\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.021888475836431227\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.010776951672862453\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.0166728624535316\"/>\n            <Body>It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out against the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or what had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home, but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men went about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them. At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the recalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards to pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The supply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange rumours began to be bandied about--rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women appeared in the harems of the Elders--women who pined and wept, and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked, stealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These tales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and re-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"9#3\" wordCount=\"255\" sentimentScore=\"0.3709090909090909\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.018585551330798478\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.013992395437262358\"/>\n         '), NULL);

Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless society. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret. The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the Prophet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every man feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were nearest his heart. One fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields, when he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window, saw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His heart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham Young himself. Full of trepidation--for he knew that such a visit boded him little good--Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. The latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with a stern face into the sitting-room. \u201cBrother Ferrier,\u201d he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly from under his light-coloured eyelashes, \u201cthe true believers have been good friends to you.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"9#4\" wordCount=\"250\" sentimentScore=\"-0.21052631578947367\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.009625984251968504\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.007196850393700787\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.009354330708661417\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.023929133858267716\"/>\n            <Body>We picked you up when you were starving in the desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our protection.

Others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease. He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an unlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:-- \u201cTwenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then----\u201d The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been.

They had sat down to their breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not enlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward.

At last, when he saw five give way to four and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of escape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The more-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could pass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him. Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter\u2019s dishonour.

It came from the door of the house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was repeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart.

Once within the house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope. \u201cGood God! \u201d gasped John Ferrier. \u201cHow you scared me! Whatever made you come in like that. \u201d \u201cGive me food,\u201d the other said, hoarsely. \u201cI have had no time for bite or sup for eight-and-forty hours. \u201d He flung himself upon the [21] cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host\u2019s supper, and devoured it voraciously. \u201cDoes Lucy bear up well? \u201d he asked, when he had satisfied his hunger. \u201cYes.

Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be half-way through the mountains. \u201d \u201cWhat if we are stopped,\u201d asked Ferrier. Hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his tunic. \u201cIf they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us,\u201d he said with a sinister smile. The lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the darkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own, and which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved himself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes. All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.

With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow, where they lay silent and trembling. It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity. \u201cTo-morrow at midnight,\u201d said the first who appeared to be in authority. \u201cWhen the Whip-poor-Will calls three times. \u201d \u201cIt is well,\u201d returned the other. \u201cShall I tell Brother Drebber? \u201d \u201cPass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven! \u201d \u201cSeven to five! \u201d repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away in different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top of his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <B'), NULL);

Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led between them was the Eagle Ca\u00f1on in which the horses were awaiting them. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he came to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon one of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path. It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face Nature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster. On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"10#13\" wordCount=\"264\" sentimentScore=\"-0.24847058823529414\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.01392193308550186\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.00896654275092937\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.006271375464684015\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.01845353159851301\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.016368029739776954\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0057211895910780665\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.023553903345724908\"/>\n            <Body>Yet in spite of all dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them, for every step increased the distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they were flying. They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the jurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and pointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them as soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of \u201cWho goes there? \u201d rang through the silent ravine. \u201cTravellers for Nevada,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the rifle which hung by his saddle. They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply. \u201cBy whose permission? \u201d he asked. \u201cThe Holy Four,\u201d answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer. \u201cNine from seven,\u201d cried the sentinel. \u201cSeven from five,\u201d returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the countersign which he had heard in the garden. \u201cPass, and the Lord go with you,\u201d said the voice from above.

More than once they lost their way, but Hope\u2019s intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other\u2019s shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a gallop. As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast.

At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag, where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there huddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours\u2019 sleep. Before daybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them. About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness, however, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life. Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"11#3\" wordCount=\"260\" sentimentScore=\"0.0\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.010299242424242424\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.01446590909090909\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.008287878787878789\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.0234469696969697\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.009818181818181818\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.00443939393939394\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.010768939393939393\"/>\n            <Body>Looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals stood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view. He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity. At last, after two or three hours\u2019 fruitless search, he was thinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn--for so it is called--was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath. The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy over his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was already drawing in.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"11#4\" wordCount=\"262\" sentimentScore=\"-0.19054545454545455\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.013307984790874524\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/'), NULL);

In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey. He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had been absent nearly five hours.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"11#5\" wordCount=\"273\" sentimentScore=\"-0.78\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.012800724637681159\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.014605072463768118\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.009681159420289853\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.03567028985507246\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.023050724637681156\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.016753623188405797\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.010753623188405797\"/>\n            <Body>In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation. When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to convictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the remains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence--a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no traces behind it. Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"11#6\" wordCount=\"263\" sentimentScore=\"-0.7650909090909092\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.005654135338345864\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.01794360902255639\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.008218045112781954\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.00'), NULL);

Had they carried back both of his companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point: JOHN FERRIER, FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, [22] Died August 4th, 1860. The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder\u2019s son. As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his last silent resting-place.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"11#7\" wordCount=\"259\" sentimentScore=\"-0.08633333333333333\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.01291923076923077\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.010453846153846154\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.00745\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.022661538461538462\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.022199999999999998\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.011269230769230767\"/>\n            <Body>Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least devote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels. For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Ca\u00f1on, from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he could look down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"11#8\" wordCount=\"254\" sentimentScore=\"-0.050800000000000005\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.010046511627906976\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.014891472868217057\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.005662790697674418\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.016015503875968996\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.0061162790697674'), NULL);

As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. He therefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier\u2019s fate had been. \u201cI am Jefferson Hope,\u201d he said. \u201cYou remember me. \u201d The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment--indeed, it was difficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly white face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former days.

There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t fear them, or their warrant,\u201d Hope said, earnestly. \u201cYou must know something of this matter, Cowper.

There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which was to have her. They\u2019d both been in the party that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber\u2019s party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one won\u2019t have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman.

Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier.

Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson\u2019s window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness. Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it.

His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier\u2019s grave. Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone.

Year passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival.

After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You\u2019d have done the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place. \u201cThat girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago.

Sometimes I followed them on my cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they could not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted. \u201cThey were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping.

I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone.

I had my enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed.

I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it.

There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result.

I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman\u2019s brougham. \u201cThis was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden path, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable for taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the others, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the length of his stride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"13#4\" wordCount=\"277\" sentimentScore=\"-0.49244444444444446\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.038647482014388494\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.012104316546762589\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.032111510791366905\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.04558992805755397\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.03172302158273381\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.014276978417266186\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.008629496402877699\"/>\n            <Body>\u201cOn entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man\u2019s person, but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features. Having sniffed the dead man\u2019s lips I detected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist. \u201cAnd now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics, then, or was it a woman? That was th'), NULL);

When the inscription was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber\u2019s former career. He answered, you remember, in the negative. \u201cI then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer\u2019s height, and furnished me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer\u2019s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly. \u201cHaving left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"13#6\" wordCount=\"255\" sentimentScore=\"-0.255\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.008701960784313727\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.019423529411764704\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.006098039215686274\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.007333333333333333\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.007729411764705883\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.013235294117647059\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.02267843137254902\"/>\n            <Body>The answer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson Hope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to secure the murderer. \u201cI had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven the cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third person, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver.

Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore organized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in any case have been prevented.
